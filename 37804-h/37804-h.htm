<p><i>Prometheus coming on earth to give fire to men appears
before the palace of Inachus in Argos on a festival of Zeus.
He interrupts the ceremony by announcing fire and persuades
Inachus to dare the anger of Zeus and accept the gift. Inachus
fetching Argeia his wife from the palace has in turn to quiet
her fears. He asks a prophecy of Prometheus who foretells the
fate of Io their daughter. Prometheus then setting flame to the
altar and writing his own name thereon in the place of Zeus
disappears.</i></p>

<p><i>The Chorus sing (1) a Hymn to Zeus with the stories of the
birth of Zeus and the marriage of Hera with the dances of the
Curetes and the Hesperides, (2) their anticipation of fire with
an Ode on Wonder, (3) a Tragic Hymn on the lot of man,
(4) a Fire-chorus, (5) a final Chorus in praise of Prometheus.</i></p>

<p><i>All the characters are good. Prometheus prologizes. He
carries a long reed.</i></p>

THE FIREGIVER</h2>

<p class="head"><i>PROMETHEUS.</i></p>

<p class="poem25">
From high Olympus and the Ã¦therial courts,<br />
Where mighty Zeus our angry king confirms<br />
The Fates' decrees and bends the wills of the gods,<br />
I come: and on the earth step with glad foot.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This variegated ocean-floor of the air,</span><br />
The changeful circle of fair land, that lies<br />
Heaven's dial, sisterly mirror of night and day:<br />
The wide o'er-wandered plain, this nether world<br />
My truant haunt is, when from jealous eyes<br />
I steal, for hither 'tis I steal, and here   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Unseen repair my joy: yet not unseen<br />
Methinks, nor seen unguessed of him I seek.<br />
Rather by swath or furrow, or where the path<br />
Is walled with corn I am found, by trellised vine<br />
Or olive set in banks or orchard trim:<br />
I watch all toil and tilth, farm, field and fold,<br />
And taste the mortal joy; since not in heaven<br />
Among our easeful gods hath facile time<br />
A touch so keen, to wake such love of life<br />
As stirs the frail and careful being, who here,   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
The king of sorrows, melancholy man,<br />
Bows at his labour, but in heart erect<br />
A god stands, nor for any gift of god<br />
Would barter his immortal-hearted prime.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could I but win this world from Zeus for mine,</span><br />
With not a god to vex my happy rule,<br />
I would inhabit here and leave high heaven:<br />
So much I love it and its race of men,<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a><span class="pagenumb">{4}</span><br />
Even as he hates them, hates both them, and me<br />
For loving what he hates, and would destroy me,   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Outcast in the scorn of all his cringing crew,<br />
For daring but to save what he would slay:<br />
And me must first destroy. Thus he denieth<br />
My heart's wish, thus my counsel sets at naught,<br />
Which him saved once, when all at stake he stood<br />
Uprisen in rebellion to overthrow<br />
The elderseated Titans, for I that day<br />
Gave him the counsels which his foes despised.<br />
Unhappy they, who had still their blissful seats<br />
Preserved and their Olympian majesty,   <span class="linenum">40</span><br />
Had they been one with me. Alas, my kin!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he, when he had taken the throne and chained</span><br />
His foes in wasteful Tartarus, said no more<br />
Where is Prometheus our wise counsellor?<br />
What saith Prometheus? tell us, O Prometheus,<br />
What Fate requires! but waxing confident<br />
And wanton, as a youth first tasting power,<br />
He wrecked the timeless monuments of heaven,<br />
The witness of the wisdom of the gods,<br />
And making all about him new, beyond   <span class="linenum">50</span><br />
Determined to destroy the race of men,<br />
And that create afresh or else have none.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then his vain mind imagined a device,</span><br />
And at his bidding all the opposÃ¨d winds<br />
Blew, and the scattered clouds and furlÃ¨d snows,<br />
From every part of heaven together flying,<br />
He with brute hands in huge disorder heaped:<br />
They with the winds' weight and his angry breath<br />
Were thawed: in cataracts they fell, and earth<br />
In darkness deep and whelmÃ¨d tempest lay,   <span class="linenum">60</span><br />
Drowned 'neath the waters. Yet on the mountain-tops<br />
Some few escaped, and some, thus warned by me,<br />
Made shift to live in vessels which outrode<br />
The season and the fury of the flood.<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a><span class="pagenumb">{5}</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when his rain was spent and from clear skies</span><br />
Zeus looking down upon the watery world,<br />
Beheld these few, the remnant of mankind,<br />
Who yet stood up and breathed; he next withdrew<br />
The seeds of fire, that else had still lain hid<br />
In withered branch and the blue flakes of flint   <span class="linenum">70</span><br />
For man to exact and use, but these withdrawn,<br />
Man with the brutes degraded would be man<br />
No more; and so the tyrant was content.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I, despised again, again upheld</span><br />
The weak, and pitying them sent sweet Hope,<br />
Bearer of dreams, enchantress fond and kind,<br />
From heaven descending on the unhindered rays<br />
Of every star, to cheer with visions fair<br />
Their unamending pains. And now this day<br />
Behold I come bearing the seal of all   <span class="linenum">80</span><br />
Which Hope had promised: for within this reed<br />
A prisoner I bring them stolen from heaven,<br />
The flash of mastering fire, and it have borne<br />
So swift to earth, that when yon noontide sun<br />
Rose from the sea at morning I was by,<br />
And unperceived of HÃªlios plunged the point<br />
I' the burning axle, and withdrew a tongue<br />
Of breathing flame, which lives to leap on earth<br />
For man the father of all fire to come.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hither have I brought it even to Argos <span class="linenum">90</span></span><br />
Unto king Inachus, him having chosen<br />
Above all mortals to receive my gift:<br />
For he is hopeful, careful, wise, and brave.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He first, when first the floods left bare the land,</span><br />
Grew warm with enterprise, and gathered men<br />
Together, and disposed their various tasks<br />
For common weal combined; for soon were seen<br />
The long straight channels dwindling on the plain,<br />
Which slow from stagnant pool and wide morass<br />
The pestilent waters to the rivers bore:     <span class="linenum">100</span><a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a><span class="pagenumb">{6}</span><br />
Then in the ruined dwellings and old tombs<br />
He dug, unbedding from the wormÃ¨d ooze<br />
Vessels and tools of trade and husbandry;<br />
Wherewith, all seasonable works restored,<br />
Oil made he and wine anew, and taught mankind<br />
To live not brutally though without fire,<br />
Tending their flocks and herds and weaving wool,<br />
Living on fruit and milk and shepherds' fare,<br />
Till time should bring back flame to smithy and hearth,<br />
Or Zeus relent. Now at these gates I stand,   <span class="linenum">110</span><br />
At this mid hour, when Inachus comes forth<br />
To offer sacrifice unto his foe.<br />
For never hath his faithful zeal forborne<br />
To pay the power, though hard, that rules the world<br />
The smokeless sacrifice; which first to-day<br />
Shall smoke, and rise at heaven in flame to brave<br />
The baffled god. See here a servant bears<br />
For the cold altar ceremonial wood:<br />
My shepherd's cloak will serve me for disguise.<br />
</p>

<p class="head"><i>SERVANT.</i></p>

<p class="poem25">
With much toil have I hewn these sapless logs.   <span class="linenum">120</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> But toil brings health, and health is happiness.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span> Here's one I know not&mdash;nay, how came he here<br />
Unseen by me? I pray thee, stranger, tell me<br />
What wouldst thou at the house of Inachus?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Intruders, friend, and travellers have glib tongues,<br />
Silence will question such.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span>                       If 'tis a message,<br />
To-day is not thy day&mdash;who sent thee hither?<br />

But he that sent me hither is I that come.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span> I smell the matter&mdash;thou wouldst serve the house?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> 'Twas for that very cause I fled my own.   <span class="linenum">131</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span> From cruelty or fear of punishment?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Cruel was my master, for he slew his father.<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a><span class="pagenumb">{7}</span><br />
His punishments thou speakest of are crimes.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span> Thou dost well flying one that slew his father.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Thy lord, they say, is kind.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span>                            Well, thou wilt see<br />
Thou may'st at once begin&mdash;come, give a hand.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> A day of freedom is a day of pleasure:<br />
And what thou doest have I never done,<br />
And understanding not might mar thy work.   <span class="linenum">140</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span> Ay true&mdash;there is a right way and a wrong<br />
In laying wood.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span>    Then let me see thee lay it:<br />
The sight of a skill'd hand will teach an art.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span> Thou seest this faggot which I now unbind,<br />
How it is packed within.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span>                      I see the cones<br />
And needles of the fir, which by the wind<br />
In melancholy places ceaselessly<br />
Sighing are strewn upon the tufted floor.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span> These took I from a sheltered bank, whereon<br />
The sun looks down at noon; for there is need   <span class="linenum">150</span><br />
The things be dry. These first I spread; and then<br />
Small sticks that snap i' the hand.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span>                                 Such are enough<br />
To burden the slow flight of labouring rooks,<br />
When on the leafless tree-tops in young March<br />
Their glossy herds assembling soothe the air<br />
With cries of solemn joy and cawings loud.<br />
And such the long-necked herons will bear to mend<br />
Their airy platform, when the loving spring<br />
Bids them take thought for their expected young.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span> See even so I cross them and cross them so:   <span class="linenum">160</span><br />
Larger and by degrees a steady stack<br />
Have built, whereon the heaviest logs may lie:<br />
And all of sun-dried wood: and now 'tis done.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> And now 'tis done, what means it now 'tis done?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span> Well, thus 'tis rightly done: but why 'tis so<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a><span class="pagenumb">{8}</span><br />
I cannot tell, nor any man here knows;<br />
Save that our master when he sacrificeth,<br />
As thou wilt hear anon, speaketh of fire;<br />
And fire he saith is good for gods and men;<br />
And the gods have it and men have it not:   <span class="linenum">170</span><br />
And then he prays the gods to send us fire;<br />
And we, against they send it, must have wood<br />
Laid ready thus as I have shewn thee here.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> To-day he sacrificeth?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Serv.</span>                      <span style="margin-left: 10%;">Ay, this noon.</span><br />
<br />
Hark! hear'st thou not? they come. The solemn flutes<br />
Warn us away; we must not here be seen<br />
In these our soilÃ¨d habits, yet may stand<br />
Where we may hear and see and not be seen.<br />

Above all mountains famous to me<br />
Is Ida and crowned with glory.<br />
There guarded of Heaven and Earth<br />
Came Rhea at fall of night<br />
To hide a wondrous birth<br />
From the Sire's unfathering sight.   <span class="linenum">210</span><br />
The halls of Cronos rang<br />
With omens of coming ill,<br />
And the mad CurÃªtes danced and sang<br />
Adown the slopes of the hill.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then all the peaks of Gnossus kindled red</span><br />
Beckoning afar unto the sinking sun,<br />
he thro' the vaporous west plunged to his bed,<br />
Sunk, and the day was done.<br />
But they, though he was fled,<br />
Such light still held, as oft   <span class="linenum">220</span><br />
Hanging in air aloft,<br />
At eve from shadowed ship<br />
The Egyptian sailor sees:<br />
Or like the twofold tip<br />
That o'er the topmost trees<br />
Flares on Parnassus, and the Theban dames<br />
Quake at the ghostly flames.<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a><span class="pagenumb">{10}</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then friendly night arose</span><br />
To succour Earth, and spread<br />
Her mantle o'er the snows   <span class="linenum">230</span><br />
And quenched their rosy red;<br />
But in the east upsprings<br />
Another light on them,<br />
SelÃªnÃ© with white wings<br />
And hueless diadem.<br />
Little could she befriend<br />
Her father's house and state,<br />
Nor her weak beams defend<br />
Hyperion from his fate.<br />
Only where'er she shines,   <span class="linenum">240</span><br />
In terror looking forth,<br />
She sees the wailing pines<br />
Stoop to the bitter North:<br />
Or searching twice or thrice<br />
Along the rocky walls,<br />
She marks the columned ice<br />
Of frozen waterfalls:<br />
But still the darkened cave<br />
Grew darker as she shone,<br />
Wherein was Rhea gone   <span class="linenum">250</span><br />
Her child to bear and save.<br />

Urgeth a voice, or in still passion sigheth,<br />
And where he loveth draweth the heart with him.   <span class="linenum">470</span><br />

Prompting thy secret musings and now shooting<br />
His feathered fancies, or in cloudy sleep<br />
Piling his painted dreams? O hark to him!<br />
For else if folly shut his joyous strength<br />
To mope in her dark prison without praise,<br />
The hidden tears with which he wails his wrong<br />
Will sour the fount of life. O hark to him!<br />
Him may'st thou trust beyond the things thou seest.<br />
For many things there be upon this earth             <span class="linenum">480</span><br />

The heavenborn spirit within him, are not there.<br />
Yet are they bold of face, and Zeus himself,<br />
Seeing that Mischief held her head on high,<br />
Lest she should go beyond his power to quell<br />
And draw the inevitable Fate that waits<br />
On utmost ill, himself preventing Fate               <span class="linenum">490</span><br />
Hasted to drown the world, and now would crush<br />
Thy little remnant: but among the gods<br />
Is one whose love and courage stir for thee;<br />

O'errules him with the laws which laws obey,<br />
And in her heavenly city enrols his heart.<br />

In prayer and meditation and still thought,        <span class="linenum">550</span><br />
And thus my peace of mind based on a floor<br />
That doth not quaver like the joys of sense:<br />
Those I possess enough in seeing my slaves<br />
And citizens enjoy, having myself<br />
Tasted for once and put their sweets away.<br />
But of that heavenly city, of which thou sayest<br />
Her laws o'errule us, have I little learnt,<br />
For when my wandering spirit hath dared alone<br />
The unearthly terror of her voiceless halls,<br />

To store from sight; but what 'tis joy to learn<br />

Are lesser kingdoms of the boundless space<br />
Wherein Fate rules; they have their several times,<br />
Their seasons and the limit of their thrones,<br />
And from the nature of eternal things<br />
Springing, themselves are changed; even as the trees<br />
Or birds or beasts of earth, which now arise<br />
To being, now in turn decay and die.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The heaven and earth thou seest, for long were held</span><br />

To what god wilt thou pray to pardon this?<br />
In vain was reason given, if man therewith<br />
Shame truth, and name it wisdom to cry down<br />
The unschooled promptings of his best desire.<br />
The beasts that have no speech nor argument<br />
Confute him, and the wild hog in the wood   <span class="linenum">650</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Sem.</span> (<i>maidens</i>). This is strange counsel.<br />

He hath heard thy prayer and sent me: ask a boon,<br />
What thing thou wilt, it shall be given thee.'<br />

Zeus sends no messenger, but I am here.<br />

Unkind. If fire thou hast, in thee 'tis kind<br />
To proffer it: but thou art more unkind<br />
Yoking heaven's wrath therewith. Nay, and how knowest thou<br />
Zeus will be angry if I take of it?<br />
Thou art a prophet: ay, but of the prophets<br />
Some have been taken in error, and honest time<br />
Has honoured many with forgetfulness.   <span class="linenum">680</span><br />
I'll make this proof of thee; Show me thy fire&mdash;<br />
Nay, give't me now&mdash;if thou be true at all,<br />
Be true so far: for the rest there's none will lose,<br />
Nor blame thee being false&mdash;where is thy fire?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> O rather, had it thus been mine to give,<br />
I would have given it thus: not adding aught<br />
Of danger or diminishment or loss;<br />
So strong is my goodwill; nor less than this<br />
My knowledge, but in knowledge all my power.<br />
Yet since wise guidance with a little means   <span class="linenum">690</span><br />
Can more than force unminded, I have skill<br />
To conjure evil and outcompass strength.<br />
Now give I thee my best, a little gift<br />
To work a world of wonder; 'tis thine own<br />
Of long desire, and with it I will give<br />
The cunning of invention and all arts<br />
In which thy hand instructed may command,<br />
Interpret, comfort, or ennoble nature;<br />
With all provision that in wisdom is,<br />
And what prevention in foreknowledge lies.   <span class="linenum">700</span><br />

To every point of thy strange chequered tale,<br />
Revealing, threatening, offering more and more,<br />
And never all, than I to this resolve.<br />

<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> I knew thy heart would fail not at the hour.<br />

More than the endurance of a harnessed brute,<br />
Flogged to his daily work, that cannot view   <span class="linenum">710</span><br />
The high design to which his labour steps?<br />
And I of all men were dishonoured most<br />
Shrinking in fear, who never shrank from toil,<br />
And found abjuring, thrusting stiffly back,<br />
The very gift for which I stretched my hands.<br />
What though I suffer? are these wintry years<br />
Of growing desolation to be held<br />
As cherishable as the suns of spring?<br />
Nay, only joyful can they be in seeing<br />
Long hopes accomplished, long desires fulfilled.   <span class="linenum">720</span><br />
And since thou hast touched ambition on the side<br />
Of nobleness, and stirred my proudest hope,<br />
And wilt fulfil this, shall I count the cost?<br />
Rather decay will triumph, and cold death<br />
Be lapped in glory, seeing strength arise<br />
From weakness, from the tomb go forth a flame.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> 'Tis well; thou art exalted now, the grace<br />
Becomes thy valiant spirit.<br />

<span class="smcap">In.</span>                         Lo! on this day<br />
Which hope despaired to see, hope manifests<br />
A vision bright as were the dreams of youth;   <span class="linenum">730</span><br />
When life was easy as a sleeper's faith<br />
Who swims in the air and dances on the sea;<br />
When all the good that scarce by toil is won,<br />
Or not at all is won, is as a flower<br />
Growing in plenty to be plucked at will:<br />
Is it a dream again or is it truth,<br />
This vision fair of Greece inhabited?<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a><span class="pagenumb">{25}</span><br />
A fairer sight than all fair Iris sees,<br />
Footing her airy arch of colours spun<br />
From Ida to Olympus, when she stays   <span class="linenum">740</span><br />
To look on Greece and thinks the sight is fair;<br />
Far fairer now, clothed with the works of men.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Ay, fairer far: for nature's varied pleasaunce<br />
Without man's life is but a desert wild,<br />
Which most, where most she mocks him, needs his aid.<br />
She knows her silence sweeter when it girds<br />
His murmurous cities, her wide wasteful curves<br />
Larger beside his economic line;<br />
Or what can add a mystery to the dark,<br />
As doth his measured music when it moves   <span class="linenum">750</span><br />
With rhythmic sweetness through the void of night?<br />
Nay, all her loveliest places are but grounds<br />
Of vantage, where with geometric hand,<br />
True square and careful compass he may come<br />
To plan and plant and spread abroad his towers,<br />
His gardens, temples, palaces and tombs.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet not all thou seest, with trancÃ¨d eye</span><br />
Looking upon the beauty that shall be,<br />
The temple-crownÃ¨d heights, the wallÃ¨d towns,<br />
Farms and cool summer seats, nor the broad ways   <span class="linenum">760</span><br />
That bridge the rivers and subdue the mountains,<br />
Nor all that travels on them, pomp or war<br />
Or needful merchandise, nor all the sails<br />
Piloting over the wind-dappled blue<br />
Of the summer-soothed Ã†gean, to thy mind<br />
Can picture what shall be: these are the face<br />
And form of beauty, but her heart and life<br />
Shall they be who shall see it, born to shield<br />
A happier birthright with intrepid arms,<br />
To tread down tyranny and fashion forth   <span class="linenum">770</span><br />
A virgin wisdom to subdue the world,<br />
To build for passion an eternal song,<br />
To shape her dreams in marble, and so sweet<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a><span class="pagenumb">{26}</span><br />
Their speech, that envious Time hearkening shall stay<br />
In fear to snatch, and hide his rugged hand.<br />
Now is the birthday of thy conquering youth,<br />
O man, and lo! Thy priest and prophet stand<br />
Beside the altar and have blessed the day.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">In.</span> Ay, blessed be this day. Where is thy fire?<br />
Or is aught else to do, ere I may take?   <span class="linenum">780</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pr.</span> This was my message, speak and there is fire.<br />

A coy inquisitive spirit, the spirit of wonder,<br />
Possesses the child in his cradle, when mortal things<br />

It busies the mind on trifles and toys and brings<br />
Her grasp from nearer to further, from smaller to greater,<br />
And slowly teaches flight to her fledgeling wings.<br />

Where'er she flutters and falls surprises await her:<br />

<p class="poem15">That but a small and easy thing now seems,<br />
Which from my house when I came forth at noon<br />
A dream was and beyond the reach of man.<br />
'Tis now a fancy of the will, a word,<br />
Liberty's lightest prize. Yet still as one<br />
Who loiters on the threshold of delight,<br />
Delaying pleasure for the love of pleasure,<br />

As shall forget this day&mdash;while one thing more<br />
I ask of thee; this evil, will it light<br />

A second time failing will not again<br />
Measure his spite against their better fate.<br />
And now the terror, which awhile o'er Earth<br />

And gnaw the tyrant's heart: for there is whispered<br />

The winter-withering hope of my whole life<br />

I told thee not and thou hast heard: this prophet,<br />
Who comes to bring us fire, hath said that Zeus<br />

Which vain Salmoneus, son of Ã†olus,<br />
Made boast to have, and from his rattling car<br />
Threw up at heaven to mock the lightning. Him<br />
The thunderer stayed not to deride, but sent<br />
One blinding fork, that in the vacant sky<br />
Shook like a serpent's tongue, which is but seen<br />
In memory, and he was not, or for burial<br />
Rode with the ashes of his royal city<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a><span class="pagenumb">{31}</span><br />
Upon the whirlwind of the riven air.   <span class="linenum">930</span><br />
And after him his brother Athamas,<br />
King of Orchomenos, in frenzy fell<br />
For Hera's wrath, and raving killed his son;<br />
And would have killed fair Ino, but that she fled<br />
Into the sea, preferring there to woo<br />
The choking waters, rather than that the arm<br />
Which had so oft embraced should do her wrong.<br />
For which old crimes the gods yet unappeased<br />
Demand a sacrifice, and the king's son<br />
Dreads the priest's knife, and all the city mourns.   <span class="linenum">940</span><br />
Or shall I say what shameful fury it was<br />
With which Poseidon smote PasiphaÃ«,<br />
But for neglect of a recorded vow:<br />
Or how ActÃ¦on fared of Artemis<br />
When he surprised her, most himself surprised:<br />
And even while he looked his boasted bow<br />
Fell from his hands, and through his veins there ran<br />
A strange oblivious trouble, darkening sense<br />
Till he knew nothing but a hideous fear<br />
Which bade him fly, and faster, as behind   <span class="linenum">950</span><br />
He heard his hounds give tongue, that through the wood<br />
Were following, closing, caught him and tore him down.<br />
And many more thus perished in their prime;<br />
Lycaon and his fifty sons, whom Zeus<br />
In their own house spied on, and unawares<br />
Watching at hand, from his disguise arose.<br />
And overset the table where they sat<br />
Around their impious feast and slew them all:<br />
AlcyonÃ¨ and Ceyx, queen and king,<br />
Who for their arrogance were changed to birds:   <span class="linenum">960</span><br />
And Cadmus now a serpent, once a king:<br />
And saddest Niobe, whom not the love<br />
Of Leto aught availed, when once her boast<br />
Went out, though all her crime was too much pride<br />
Of heaven's most precious gift, her children fair.<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a><span class="pagenumb">{32}</span><br />
Six daughters had she, and six stalwart sons;<br />
But Leto bade her two destroy the twelve.<br />
And somewhere now, among lone mountain rocks<br />
On Sipylus, where couch the nymphs at night<br />
Who dance all day by Achelous' stream,   <span class="linenum">970</span><br />
The once proud mother lies, herself a rock,<br />
And in cold breast broods o'er the goddess' wrong.<br />

Or if thou fear, fear passion; for the freshes<br />
Of tenderness and motherly love will drown<br />

Of the soft quality fits woman well,<br />
I praise thee; nor would ask thee less to aid<br />
With counsel, than in love to share my choice.<br />
Tho' weak thy hands to poise, thine eye may mark   <span class="linenum">980</span><br />
This balance, how the good of all outweighs<br />
The good of one or two, though these be us.<br />
Let not reluctance shame the sacrifice<br />
Which in another thou wert first to praise.<br />

<span class="smcap">Ar.</span> Alas for me, for thee and for our children,<br />
Who, being our being, having all our having,<br />
If they fare ill, our pride lies in the dust.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">In.</span> O deem not a man's children are but those<br />
Out of his loins engendered&mdash;our spirit's love<br />
Hath such prolific consequence, that Virtue   <span class="linenum">990</span><br />
Cometh of ancestry more pure than blood,<br />
And counts her seed as sand upon the shore.<br />
Happy is he whose body's sons proclaim<br />
Their father's honour, but more blest to whom<br />
The world is dutiful, whose children spring<br />
Out of all nations, and whose pride the proud<br />
Rise to regenerate when they call him sire.<br />

Aulis and Mycalessus to the point<br />
Of vext Euripus: fear not then the stream,<br />
Nor scenting think to taste, but plunging in<br />
Breast its salt current to the further shore.<br />
For on this island mayst thou lose awhile<br />
Thy maddening pest, and rest and pasture find,<br />
And from the heafs of bold Macistus see<br />
The country left and sought: but when thou feel<br />
Thy torment urge, move down, recross the flood,   <span class="linenum">1100</span><br />

Which doubled, Thrace receives thee: barbarous names<br />
Of mountain, town and river, and a people<br />
Strange to thine eyes and ears, the Agathyrsi,<br />
Of pictured skins, who owe no marriage law,<br />
And o'er whose gay-spun garments sprent with gold<br />
Their hanging hair is blue. Their torrent swim<br />

Through whose rude rocks and frosty silences<br />
No path shall guide thee then, nor my words now.<br />
There as thou toilest o'er the treacherous snows,<br />
A sound then thou shall hear to stop thy breath,<br />
And prick thy trembling ears; a far-off cry,<br />
Whose throat seems the white mountain and its passion<br />
The woe of earth. Flee not, nor turn not back:   <span class="linenum">1160</span><br />
Let thine ears drink and guide thine eyes to see<br />
That sight whose terrors shall assuage thy terror,<br />
Whose pain shall kill thy pain. Stretched on the rock,<br />
Naked to scorching sun, to pinching frost,<br />
To wind and storm and beaks of wingÃ¨d fiends<br />
From year to year he lies. Refrain to ask<br />
His name and crime&mdash;nay, haply when thou see him<br />
Thou wilt remember&mdash;'tis thy tyrant's foe,<br />
Man's friend, who pays his chosen penalty.<br />

Doomed and accurst!<br />

And imminent dread:<br />
Because there is no mischief thought or said,<br />

At any moment; in the air,   <span class="linenum">1190</span><br />
Or on the earth or sea,<br />
Or in the fair<br />
And tender body itself it lurks, creeps in,<br />
Or seizes suddenly,<br />
Torturing, burning, withering, devouring,<br />
Shaking, destroying; till tormented life<br />
Sides with the slayer, not to be,<br />
And from the cruel strife<br />
Falls to fate overpowering.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or if some patient heart, <span class="linenum">1200</span></span><br />
In toilsome steps of duty tread apart,<br />
Thinking to win her peace within herself,<br />

<p><i>The scene is in the flowery valley below Enna. Hades
prologizes, and tells how he has come with consent of Zeus to
carry off Persephone to be his queen. The Chorus of Ocean
nymphs entering praise Sicily and the spring. Persephone
enters with Athena and Artemis to gather flowers for the
festival of Zeus. Persephone being left alone is carried off by
Hades.</i></p>

<p><i>In the second act, which is ten days later, the Chorus deplore
the loss of Persephone. Demeter entering upbraids them in
a choric scene and describes her search for Persephone until
she learnt her fate from Helios. Afterwards she describes her
plan for compelling Zeus to restore her. Hermes brings from
Zens a command to Demeter that she shall return to Olympus.
She sends defiance to Zeus, and the Chorus end the scene by
vowing to win Poseidon to aid Demeter.</i></p>

<p><i>In the third act, which is a year later, the Chorus, who
have been summoned by Demeter to witness the restoration of
Persephone, lament Demeter's anger. Demeter narrates the
Eleusinian episode of her wanderings, until Hermes enters
leading Persephone. After their greeting Demeter hears from
Hermes the terms of Persephone's restoration; she is reconciled
thereto by Persephone, and invites her to Eleusis. The Chorus
sing and crown Persephone with flowers.</i></p>

I am the King of Hell, nor prone to vex<br />
Eternal destiny with weak complaint;<br />
Nor when I took my kingdom did I mourn<br />
My lot, from heav'n expell'd, deny'd to enjoy<br />
Its radiant revelry and ambrosial feast,<br />
Nor blamed our mighty Sisters, that not one<br />
Would share my empire in the shades of night.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when a younger race of gods arose,</span><br />
And Zeus set many sons on heav'nly seats,<br />
And many daughters dower'd with new domain,   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
And year by year were multiply'd on earth<br />
Their temples and their statu'd sanctities,<br />
Mirrors of man's ideas that grow apace,<br />
Yea, since man's mind was one with my desire<br />
That Hell should have a queen,&mdash;for heav'n hath queens<br />
Many, nor on all earth reigns any king<br />
In unkind isolation like to me,&mdash;<br />
I claimed from Zeus that of the fair immortals<br />
One should be given to me to grace my throne.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Willing he was, and quick to praise my rule, <span class="linenum">20</span></span><br />
And of mere justice there had granted me<br />
Whome'er I chose: but 'Brother mine,' he said,<br />
'Great as my power among the gods, this thing<br />
I cannot compass, that a child of mine,<br />
Who once hath tasted of celestial life,<br />
Should all forgo, and destitute of bliss<br />
Descend into the shades, albeit to sit<br />
An equal on thy throne. Take whom thou wilt;<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a><span class="pagenumb">{52}</span><br />
But by triumphant force persuade, as erst<br />
I conquer'd heav'n.' Said I 'My heart is set:   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
I take Demeter's child Persephone;<br />
Dost thou consent?' Whereto he gave his nod.<br />
And I am come to-day with hidden powers,<br />
Ev'n unto Enna's fair Sicilian field,<br />
To rob her from the earth. 'Tis here she wanders<br />
With all her train: nor is this flow'ry vale<br />
Fairer among the fairest vales of earth,<br />
Nor any flower within this flow'ry vale<br />
Fair above other flowers, as she is fairest<br />
Among immortal goddesses, the daughter   <span class="linenum">40</span><br />
Of gentle-eyed Demeter; and her passion<br />
Is for the flowers, and every tenderness<br />
That I have long'd for in my fierce abodes.<br />
But she hath always in attendant guard<br />
The dancing nymphs of Ocean, and to-day<br />
The wise Athena and chaste Artemis<br />
Indulge her girlish fancy, gathering flowers<br />
To deck the banner of my golden brother,<br />
Whose thought they guess not, tho' their presence here<br />
Affront his will and mine. If once alone   <span class="linenum">50</span><br />
I spy her, I can snatch her swiftly down:<br />
And after shall find favour for my fault,<br />
When I by gentle means have won her love.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I hear their music now. Hither they come:</span><br />

But for the idle flowers she hath little care:<br />
She will resign them willingly. And think not,<br />
Thou wise Athena, I shall go unhonour'd,<br />
Or rank a meaner goddess unto man.<br />
His spirit setteth beauty before wisdom,   <span class="linenum">220</span><br />
Pleasures above necessities, and thus<br />
He ever adoreth flowers. Nor this I guess<br />
Where rich men only and superfluous kings<br />
Around their palaces reform the land<br />
To terraces and level lawns, whereon<br />
Appointed slaves are told, to tend and feed<br />
Lilies and roses and all rarest plants<br />
Fetch'd from all lands; that they&mdash;these lordly men&mdash;<br />
'Twixt flaunting avenues and wafted odours<br />
May pace in indolence: this is their bliss;   <span class="linenum">230</span><br />
This first they do: and after, it may be,<br />
Within their garden set their academe:&mdash;<br />
But in the poorest villages, around<br />
The meanest cottage, where no other solace<br />
Comforts the eye, some simple gaiety<br />
Of flowers in tended garden is seen; some pinks,<br />
Tulips, or crocuses that edge the path;<br />
Where oft at eve the grateful labourer<br />
Sits in his jasmin'd porch, and takes the sun:<br />
And even the children, that half-naked go,   <span class="linenum">240</span><br />
Have posies in their hands, and of themselves<br />
Will choose a queen in whom to honour Spring,<br />
Dancing before her garlanded with may.<br />
The cowslip makes them truant, they forget<br />
The hour of hunger and their homely feast<br />
So they may cull the delicate primrose,<br />
Sealing their birthright with the touch of beauty;<br />
With unconsider'd hecatombs assuring<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a><span class="pagenumb">{59}</span><br />

Excellent artistry; elaboration<br />
Confounded with simplicity, till none<br />

A scented iris, I should be content:<br />

With flow'ry woodland, stately mountain and valley,<br />

<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> I welcome you, my loving true allies,<br />

Harass'd the foe. Here on this field of flowers<br />
I have bid you share my victory or defeat.   <span class="linenum">700</span><br />
For Hermes hath this day command from Zeus<br />
To lead our lost Persephone from Hell,<br />
Hither whence she was stolen.&mdash;And yet, alas!<br />
Tho' Zeus is won, some secret power thwarts me;<br />
All is not won: a cloud is o'er my spirit.<br />
Wherefore not yet I boast, nor will rejoice<br />
Till mine eyes see her, and my arms enfold her,<br />
And breast to breast we meet in fond embrace.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Well hast thou fought, great goddess, so to wrest<br />
Zeus from his word. We thank thee, call'd to share   <span class="linenum">710</span><br />

Make thou this day a day of peace for man!<br />

Self-exiled from the heav'ns, forgone, alone,<br />
My anguish fasten'd on me, as I went<br />
Wandering an alien in the haunts of men.<br />
To screen my woe I put my godhead off,<br />
Taking the likeness of a worthy dame,<br />
A woman of the people well in years;<br />
Till going unobserv'd, it irked me soon<br />
To be unoccupy'd save by my grief,<br />
While men might find distraction for their sorrows<br />
In useful toil. Then, of my pity rather   <span class="linenum">740</span><br />
Than hope to find their simple cure my own,<br />
I took resolve to share and serve their needs,<br />
And be as one of them.<br />

Coudst thou so put thy dignities away,<br />
And suffer the familiar brunt of men?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> In all things even as they.&mdash;And sitting down<br />
One evening at Eleusis, by the well<br />
Under an olive-tree, likening myself<br />
Outwardly to some kindly-hearted matron,<br />
Whose wisdom and experience are of worth   <span class="linenum">750</span><br />
Either where childhood clamorously speaks<br />
The engrossing charge of Aphrodite's gifts,<br />
Or merry maidens in wide-echoing halls<br />
Want sober governance;&mdash;to me, as there<br />
I sat, the daughters of King Keleos came,<br />
Tall noble damsels, as kings' daughters are,<br />
And, marking me a stranger, they drew from me<br />
A tale told so engagingly, that they<br />
Grew fain to find employment for my skill;<br />
&mdash;As men devise in mutual recompense,   <span class="linenum">760</span><br />
Hoping the main advantage for themselves;&mdash;<br />
And so they bad me follow, and I enter'd<br />
The palace of King Keleos, and received<br />
There on my knees the youngest of the house,<br />
A babe, to nurse him as a mother would:<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a><span class="pagenumb">{75}</span><br />
And in that menial service I was proud<br />
To outrun duty and trust: and there I liv'd<br />
Disguised among the maidens many months.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Often as have our guesses aim'd, dear Lady,<br />
Where thou didst hide thyself, oft as we wonder'd   <span class="linenum">770</span><br />
What chosen work was thine, none ever thought<br />
That thou didst deign to tend a mortal babe.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> What life I led shall be for men to tell.<br />
But for this babe, the nursling of my sorrow,<br />
Whose peevish cry was my consoling care,<br />
How much I came to love him ye shall hear.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Ch.</span> What was he named, Lady?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span>                         <span style="margin-left: 10%">DemophoÃ¶n.</span><br />
Yea, ye shall hear how much I came to love him.<br />
For in his small epitome I read<br />
The trouble of mankind; in him I saw   <span class="linenum">780</span><br />
The hero's helplessness, the countless perils<br />
In ambush of life's promise, the desire<br />
Blind and instinctive, and the will perverse.<br />
His petty needs were man's necessities;<br />
In him I nurst all mortal natur', embrac'd<br />
With whole affection to my breast, and lull'd<br />
Wailing humanity upon my knee.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Ch.</span> We see thou wilt not now destroy mankind.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> What I coud do to save man was my thought.<br />
And, since my love was center'd in the boy,   <span class="linenum">790</span><br />
My thought was first for him, to rescue him;<br />
That, thro' my providence, he ne'er should know<br />
Suffering, nor disease, nor fear of death.<br />
Therefore I fed him on immortal food,<br />
And should have gain'd my wish, so well he throve,<br />
But by ill-chance it hapt, once, as I held him<br />
Bathed in the fire at midnight (as was my wont),&mdash;<br />
His mother stole upon us, and ascare<br />
At the strange sight, screaming in loud dismay<br />
Compel'd me to unmask, and leave for ever     <span class="linenum">800</span><a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a><span class="pagenumb">{76}</span><br />
The halls of Keleos, and my work undone.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Ch.</span> 'Twas pity that she came!&mdash;Didst thou not grieve to lose<br />
The small DemophoÃ¶n?&mdash;Coudst thou not save him?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> I had been blinded. Think ye for yourselves ...<br />
What vantage were it to mankind at large<br />
That one should be immortal,&mdash;if all beside<br />
Must die and suffer misery as before?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Nay, truly. And great envy borne to one<br />
So favour'd might have more embitter'd all.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> I had been foolish. My sojourn with men   <span class="linenum">810</span><br />
Had warpt my mind with mortal tenderness.<br />
So, questioning myself what real gift<br />
I might bestow on man to help his state,<br />
I saw that sorrow was his life-companion,<br />
To be embrac't bravely, not weakly shun'd:<br />
That as by toil man winneth happiness,<br />
Thro' tribulation he must come to peace.<br />
How to make sorrow his friend then,&mdash;this my task.<br />
Here was a mystery ... and how persuade<br />
This thorny truth?... Ye do not hearken me.   <span class="linenum">820</span><br />

Where in the sorrow that I underwent<br />
Man's state is pattern'd; and in picture shewn<br />

My project with mysterious efficacy:     <span class="linenum">900</span><a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a><span class="pagenumb">{79}</span><br />
And as a plant that yearly dieth down<br />
When summer is o'er, and hideth in the earth,<br />
Nor showeth promise in its wither'd leaves<br />
That it shall reawaken and put forth<br />
Its blossoms any more to deck the spring;<br />
So I, the mutual symbol of my choice,<br />
Shall die with winter, and with spring revive.<br />
How without winter coud I have my spring?<br />
How come to resurrection without death?<br />
Lo thus our joyful meeting of to-day,   <span class="linenum">910</span><br />
Born of our separation, shall renew<br />
Its annual ecstasy, by grief refresht:<br />
And no more pall than doth the joy of spring<br />
Yearly returning to the hearts of men.<br />
See then the accomplishment of all my hope:<br />
Rejoice, and think not to put off my crown.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> What hast thou seen below to reconcile thee<br />
To the dark moiety of thy strange fate?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> Where have I been, mother? what have I seen?<br />
The downward pathway to the gates of death:   <span class="linenum">920</span><br />
The skeleton of earthly being, stript<br />
Of all disguise: the sudden void of night:<br />
The spectral records of unwholesome fear:&mdash;<br />
Why was it given to me to see these things?<br />
The ruin'd godheads, disesteem'd, condemn'd<br />
To toil of deathless mockery: conquerors<br />
In the reverse of glory, doom'd to rule<br />
The multitudinous army of their crimes:<br />
The naked retribution of all wrong:&mdash;<br />
Why was it given to me to see such things?   <span class="linenum">930</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> Not without terror, as I think, thou speakest,<br />
Nor as one reconcil'd to brook return.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> But since I have seen these things, with salt and fire<br />
My spirit is purged, and by this crystal crown<br />
Terror is tamed within me. If my words<br />
Seem'd to be tinged with terror, 'twas because<a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a><span class="pagenumb">{80}</span><br />
I knew one hour of terror (on the day<br />
That took me hence) and with that memory<br />
Colour'd my speech, using the terms which paint<br />
The blindfold fears of men, who little reckon   <span class="linenum">940</span><br />
How they by holy innocence and love,<br />
By reverence and gentle lives may win<br />
A title to the fair Elysian fields,<br />
Where the good spirits dwell in ease and light<br />
And entertainment of those fair desires<br />
That made earth beautiful ... brave souls that spent<br />
Their lives for liberty and truth, grave seers<br />
Whose vision conquer'd darkness, pious poets<br />
Whose words have won Apollo's deathless praise,<br />
Who all escape Hell's mysteries, nor come nigh   <span class="linenum">950</span><br />
The Cave of Cacophysia.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span>                    <span style="margin-left: 10%">Mysteries!</span><br />
What mysteries are these? and what the Cave?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> The mysteries of evil, and the cave<br />
Of blackness that obscures them. Even in hell<br />
The worst is hidden, and unfructuous night<br />
Stifles her essence in her truthless heart.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> What is the arch-falsity? I seek to know<br />
The mystery of evil. Hast thou seen it?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> I have seen it. Coud I truly rule my kingdom<br />
Not having seen it?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span>                <span style="margin-left: 10%">Tell me what it is. </span>  <span class="linenum">960</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Per.</span> 'Tis not that I forget it; tho' the thought<br />
Is banisht from me. But 'tis like a dream<br />
Whose sense is an impression lacking words.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> If it would pain thee telling ...<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span>                                   <span style="margin-left: 10%">Nay, but surely</span><br />
The words of gods and men are names of things<br />
And thoughts accustom'd: but of things unknown<br />
And unimagin'd are no words at all.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> And yet will words sometimes outrun the thought.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> What can be spoken is nothing: 'twere a path<a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a><span class="pagenumb">{81}</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> Yet what is outward easy is to tell.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> Something is possible. This cavern lies<br />
In very midmost of deep-hollow'd hell.<br />
O'er its torn mouth the black Plutonic rock<br />
Is split in sharp disorder'd pinnacles<br />
And broken ledges, whereon sit, like apes<br />
Upon a wither'd tree, the hideous sins<br />
Of all the world: once having seen within   <span class="linenum">980</span><br />
The magnetism is heavy on them, and they crawl<br />
Palsied with filthy thought upon the peaks;<br />
Or, squatting thro' long ages, have become<br />
Rooted like plants into the griping clefts:<br />
And there they pullulate, and moan, and strew<br />
The rock with fragments of their mildew'd growth.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> Cora, my child! and hast thou seen these things!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> Nay but the outward aspect, figur'd thus<br />
In mere material loathsomeness, is nought<br />
Beside the mystery that is hid within.   <span class="linenum">990</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> Search thou for words, I pray, somewhat to tell.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> Are there not matters past the thought of men<br />
Or gods to know?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span>             <span style="margin-left: 5%">Thou meanest wherefore things</span><br />
Should be at all? Or, if they be, why thus,<br />
As hot, cold, hard and soft: and wherefore Zeus<br />
Had but two brothers; why the stars of heaven<br />
Are so innumerable, constellated<br />
Just as they are; or why this Sicily<br />
Should be three-corner'd? Yes, thou sayest well,<br />
Why things are as they are, nor gods nor men   <span class="linenum">1000</span><br />
Can know. We say that Fate appointed thus,<br />
And are content.&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> Suppose, dear Mother, there wer' a temple in heaven,<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a><span class="pagenumb">{82}</span><br />
Which, dedicated to the unknown Cause<br />
And worship of the unseen, had power to draw<br />
All that was worthy and good within its gate:<br />
And that the spirits who enter'd there became<br />
Not only purified and comforted,<br />
But that the mysteries of the shrine were such,<br />
That the initiated bathed in light   <span class="linenum">1010</span><br />
Of infinite intelligence, and saw<br />
The meaning and the reason of all things,<br />
All at a glance distinctly, and perceived<br />
The origin of all things to be good,<br />
And the Ã©nd good, and that what appears as evil<br />
Is as a film of dust, that faln thereon,<br />
May,&mdash;at one stroke of the hand,&mdash;<br />
Be brush'd away, and show the good beneath,<br />
Solid and fair and shining: If moreover<br />
This blessÃ«d vision were of so great power   <span class="linenum">1020</span><br />
That none coud e'er forget it or relapse<br />
To doubtful ignorance:&mdash;I say, dear Mother,<br />
Suppose that there were such a temple in heaven.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> O child, my child! that were a temple indeed.<br />
'Tis such a temple as man needs on earth;<br />
A holy shrine that makes no pact with sin,<br />
A worthy shrine to draw the worthy and good,<br />
A shrine of wisdom trifling not with folly,<br />
A shrine of beauty, where the initiated<br />
Drank love and light.... Strange thou shouldst speak of it.<br />
I have inaugurated such a temple   <span class="linenum">1031</span><br />
These last days in Eleusis, have ordain'd<br />
These very mysteries!&mdash;Strange thou speakest of it.<br />
But by what path return we to the Cave<br />
Of Cacophysia?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span>           <span style="margin-left: 5%">By this path, dear Mother.</span><br />
The Cave of Cacophysia is in all things<br />
T'ward evil, as that temple were t'ward good.<br />
I enter'd in. Outside the darkness was<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a><span class="pagenumb">{83}</span><br />
But as accumulated sunlessness;<br />
Within 'twas positive as light itself,   <span class="linenum">1040</span><br />
A blackness that extinguished: Yet I knew,<br />
For Hades told me, that I was to see;<br />
And so I waited, till a forking flash<br />
Of sudden lightning dazzlingly reveal'd<br />
All at a glance. As on a pitchy night<br />
The warder of some high acropolis<br />
Looks down into the dark, and suddenly<br />
Sees all the city with its roofs and streets,<br />
Houses and walls, clear as in summer noon,<br />
And ere he think of it, 'tis dark again,&mdash;   <span class="linenum">1050</span><br />
So I saw all within the Cave, and held<br />
The vision, 'twas so burnt upon my sense.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> What saw'st thou, child? what saw'st thou?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span>                                            <span style="margin-left: 10%">Nay, the things</span><br />
Not to be told, because there are no words<br />
Of gods or men to paint the inscrutable<br />
And full initiation of hell.&mdash;I saw<br />
The meaning and the reason of all things,<br />
All at a glance, and in that glance perceiv'd<br />
The origin of all things to be evil,<br />
And the Ã©nd evil: that what seems as good   <span class="linenum">1060</span><br />
Is as a bloom of gold that spread thereo'er<br />
May, by one stroke of the hand,<br />
Be brush'd away, and leave the ill beneath<br />
Solid and foul and black....<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span>                         <span style="margin-left: 10%">Now tell me, child,</span><br />
If Hades love thee, that he sent thee thither.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> He said it coud not harm me: and I think<br />
It hath not.      <span style="margin-left: 10%">[<i>Going up to Demeter, who kisses her.</i></span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span>         <span style="margin-left: 3%">Nay it hath not, ... and I know</span><br />
The power of evil is no power at all<br />
Against eternal good. 'Tis fire on water,<br />
As darkness against sunlight, like a dream   <span class="linenum">1070</span><br />
To waken'd will. Foolish was I to fear<a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a><span class="pagenumb">{84}</span><br />
That aught coud hurt thee, Cora. But to-day<br />
Speak we no more.... This mystery of Hell<br />
Will do me service: I'll not tell thee now:<br />
But sure it is that Fate o'erruleth all<br />
For good or ill: and we (no more than men)<br />
Have power to oppose, nor any will nor choice<br />
Beyond such wisdom as a fisher hath<br />
Who driven by sudden gale far out to sea<br />
Handles his fragile boat safe thro' the waves,   <span class="linenum">1080</span><br />
Making what harbour the wild storm allows.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-day hard-featured and inscrutable Fate</span><br />
Stands to mine eyes reveal'd, nor frowns upon me.<br />
I thought to find thee as I knew thee, and fear'd<br />
Only to find thee sorrowful: I find thee<br />
Far other than thou wert, nor hurt by Hell.<br />
I thought I must console thee, but 'tis thou<br />
Playest the comforter: I thought to teach thee,<br />
And had prepared my lesson, word by word;<br />
But thou art still beyond me. One thing only   <span class="linenum">1090</span><br />
Of all my predetermin'd plan endures:<br />
My purpose was to bid thee to Eleusis<br />
For thy spring festival, which three days hence<br />
Inaugurates my temple. Thou wilt come?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> I come. And art thou reconcil'd, dear Mother?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dem.</span> Joy and surprise make tempest in my mind;<br />
When their bright stir is o'er, there will be peace.<br />
But ere we leave this flowery field, the scene<br />
Of strange and beauteous memories evermore,<br />
I thank thee, Hermes, for thy willing service.   <span class="linenum">1100</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Per.</span> I thank thee, son of Maia, and bid farewell.<br />
<br />

Fairest Persephone, Queen of the Spring.<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a><span class="pagenumb">{85}</span><br />

In midmost length of hundred-citied Crete,<br />
The land that cradl'd Zeus, of old renown,<br />
Where grave Demeter nurseried her wheat,<br />
And Minos fashion'd law, ere he went down<br />
To judge the quaking hordes of Hell's domain,<br />
There dwelt a King on the Omphalian plain<br />
Eastward of Ida, in a little town.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem20">
<span style="margin-left: 15%">2</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
Three daughters had this King, of whom my tale<br />
Time hath preserved, that loveth to despise<br />
The wealth which men misdeem of much avail,<br />
Their glories for themselves that they devise;<br />
For clerkly is he, old hard-featured Time,<br />
And poets' fabl'd song and lovers' rhyme<br />
He storeth on his shelves to please his eyes.<br />

<p class="poem20">
<span style="margin-left: 15%">3</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
These three princesses all were fairest fair;<br />
And of the elder twain 'tis truth to say<br />
That if they stood not high above compare,<br />
Yet in their prime they bore the palm away;<br />
Outwards of loveliness; but Nature's mood,<br />
Gracious to make, had grudgingly endued<br />
And marr'd by gifting ill the beauteous clay.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem20">
<span style="margin-left: 15%">4</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
And being in honour they were well content<br />
To feed on lovers' looks and courtly smiles,<br />
To hang their necks with jewel'd ornament,<br />
And gold, that vanity in vain beguiles,<br />
And live in gaze, and take their praise for due,<br />
To be the fairest maidens then to view<br />
Within the shores of Greece and all her isles.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 15%">5</span><br />&nbsp; <br />

There is no likeness; since she was as far<br />
From pictured beauty as is ugliness,<br />
Though on the side where heavenly wonders are,<br />
Ideals out of being and above,<br />
Which music worshippeth, but if love love,<br />
'Tis, as the poet saith, to love a star.<br />

Her vision rather drave from passion's heart<br />
What earthly soil it had afore possest;<br />
Since to man's purer unsubstantial part<br />
The brightness of her presence was addrest:<br />
And such as mock'd at God, when once they saw<br />
Her heavenly glance, were humbl'd, and in awe<br />
Of things unseen, return'd to praise the Best.<br />

And so before her, wheresoe'er she went,<br />
Hushing the crowd a thrilling whisper ran,<br />
And silent heads were reverently bent;<br />
Till from the people the belief began<br />
That Love's own mother had come down on earth,<br />
Sweet Cytherea, or of mortal birth<br />
A greater Goddess was vouchsaf't to man.<br />

<p class="poem20">
<span style="margin-left: 15%">8</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
Then Aphrodite's statue in its place<br />
Stood without worshippers; if Cretans pray'd<br />
For beauty or for children, love or grace,<br />
The prayer and vow were offer'd to the maid;<br />
Unto the maid their hymns of praise were sung,<br />
Their victims bled for her, for her they hung<br />
Garland and golden gift, and none forbade.<br />

And thence opinion spread beyond the shores,<br />
From isle to isle the wonder flew, it came<br />
Across the Ã†gÃ¦an on a thousand oars,<br />
Athens and Smyrna caught the virgin's fame;<br />
And East or West, where'er the tale had been,<br />
The adoration of the foam-born queen<br />
Fell to neglect, and men forgot her name.<br />

The fragrant altar by the Graces served<br />
At Cnidus was forsaken; pilgrims fail'd<br />
The rocky island to her name reserved,<br />
Proud Ephyra, and Meropis renown'd;<br />
'Twas all for Crete her votaries were bound,<br />
And to the Cretan maid her worship swerved.<br />

Fount of desire and beauty without flaw,<br />
Herself the life that doth the world adorn;<br />
Seeing that without her generative might<br />
Nothing can spring upon the shores of light,<br />
Nor any bud of joy or love be born;<br />

Her indignation, that a mortal frail<br />

Her fair Hellenic empire to assail,<br />
For which she had fled the doom of Ninus old,<br />
And left her wanton images unsoul'd<br />
In Babylon and Zidon soon to fail.<br />

As soon shall cure her tribe of worshipping:<br />
Her beauty will I mock with loathÃ¨d lust,<br />
Bow down her dainty spirit to the dust,<br />
And leave her long alive to feel the sting.'<br />

The fruit adulterous, which for man's annoy<br />
To that fierce partner Cytherea bore,<br />
Eros, the ever young, who only grew<br />
In mischief, and was Cupid named anew<br />
In westering aftertime of latin lore.<br />

When beauty, from its fleshy bud unpent,<br />
Flaunts like the corol of a summer flower,<br />
As if all life were for that ornament,<br />
Such Eros seemed in years, a trifler gay,<br />

For ever spending, and yet never spent.<br />

Lively as fire, and redder than the blood,<br />
And maketh in his eyes small flashes dart,<br />
And curleth his hair golden, and distilleth<br />
Honey on his tongue, and all his body filleth<br />
With wanton lightsomeness in every part.<br />

Red, iridescent, are his shoulders fledged.<br />
A bow his weapon, which he deftly strings,<br />
And little arrows barb'd and keenly edged;<br />
And these he shooteth true; but else the youth<br />
For all his seeming recketh naught of truth,<br />
But most deceiveth where he most is pledged.<br />

The inner rooms glow'd with inviting shade:<br />
And, standing in the court, she might behold<br />
Cedar, and silk, and silver; and that all<br />

She waited: when again <span class="english">Lady, draw near;<br />

And one, if she would rest, would show her bed,<br />

Like as the high gods have it when they dine:<br />
Or, would she bathe, were those would heat the bath;<br />
The joyous cries contending in her path,<br />

Those sightless tongues; and well by dream she knew<br />
The voices of the messengers of prayer,<br />
Which fly upon the gods' commandment, when<br />

So calling loud her name, 'Psyche!' they cried,<br />

'Midst of her garden, where she had her seat.<br />

So entering by the golden gate, or e'er<br />

Their eyes that lit on beauty were enchain'd;<br />
And Psyche's airy service, as she bade,<br />
Perform'd its magic office, and display'd<br />
The riches of the palace where she reign'd.<br />

And wine more precious than its golden cup.<br />

'So let it be, and so shall we be saved.'<br />
Which meditated vengeance of his fear<br />
When Psyche heard, now for their life she craved,<br />
Whose mere distress erewhile had toucht her near.<br />
Around her lover's neck her arms she threw,<br />
And pleaded for them by her faith so true,<br />

Where food she found, or shelter through the land<br />
By day or night; until by fate control'd<br />
She came by steep ways to the southern strand,<br />
Where, sacred to the Twins and Britomart,<br />
Pent in its rocky theatre apart,<br />
A little town stood on the level sand.<br />

And knocking begg'd to see her sister dear;<br />
But when in state stepp'd down that haughty queen,<br />
And saw the wan face spent with tears and teen,<br />
She smiled, and said 'Psyche, what dost thou here?'<br />

Their means, and done their bidding not amiss,<br />
Looking on him her hand would have destroy'd,<br />

Even as she kisst, a drop of burning oil<br />
Fall'n from the lamp had served her scheme to foil,<br />
Discovering her in vision of her bliss;<br />

The jealous fancy of her silly lust:<br />
And pitilessly with triumphant look<br />
She drank the flattery, and gave full trust;<br />
And leaving Psyche ere she more coud tell,<br />
Ran off to bid her spouse for aye farewell,<br />
And in his ear this ready lie she thrust:<br />

A single lamp there stood beside the heap,<br />

The shade, she bent her down the flame to trim;<br />
And there the beast itself, a little ant,<br />
Climb'd up in compass of the lustre scant,<br />
Upon the bowl of oil ran round the rim.<br />

So dwarf'd by truth, she watcht him where he crept,<br />

What straits she then was in, and telling wept.<br />
Whereat he stood and trim'd his horns; but ere<br />
Her tale was done resumed his manner scare,<br />
Ran down, and on his way in darkness kept.<br />

<p class="poem20">

But she intent drew forth with dextrous hand<br />
The larger seeds, or push'd the smaller back,<br />

With grappling horns: and each from out the heap<br />

Wounding his heart to wonder what might be<br />
God's purpose in a soul of such degree;<br />
And there he had left me but for mandate strong.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But seeing thee with me now, his task at close</span><br />
He knoweth, and wherefore he was bid to stay,<br />
And work confusion of so many foes:<br />
The thanks that he doth look for, here I pay,<br />
Yet fear some heavenly envy, as he goes<br />
Unto what great reward I cannot say.<br />

I will be what God made me, nor protest<br />
Against the bent of genius in my time,<br />
That science of my friends robs all the best,<br />
While I love beauty, and was born to rhyme.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Be they our mighty men, and let me dwell</span><br />
In shadow among the mighty shades of old,<br />
With love's forsaken palace for my cell;<br />
Whence I look forth and all the world behold,<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And say, These better days, in best things worse,</span><br />
This bastardy of time's magnificence,<br />
Will mend in fashion and throw off the curse,<br />
To crown new love with higher excellence.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Curs'd tho' I be to live my life alone,</span><br />
My toil is for man's joy, his joy my own.<br />

I live on hope and that I think do all<br />
Who come into this world, and since I see<br />
Myself in swim with such good company,<br />
I take my comfort whatsoe'er befall.<br />
I abide and abide, as if more stout and tall<br />
My spirit would grow by waiting like a tree;<br />
And, clear of others' toil, it pleaseth me<br />
In dreams their quick ambition to forestall.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And if thro' careless eagerness I slide</span><br />
To some accomplishment, I give my voice<br />
Still to desire, and in desire abide.<br />
I have no stake abroad; if I rejoice<br />
In what is done or doing, I confide<br />
Neither to friend nor foe my secret choice.<br />

Ye blessed saints, that now in heaven enjoy<br />
The purchase of those tears, the world's disdain,<br />
Doth Love still with his war your peace annoy,<br />
Or hath Death freed you from his ancient pain?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Have ye no springtide, and no burst of May</span><br />
In flowers and leafy trees, when solemn night<br />
Pants with love-music, and the holy day<br />
Breaks on the ear with songs of heavenly light?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What make ye and what strive for? keep ye thought</span><br />
Of us, or in new excellence divine<br />
Is old forgot? or do ye count for nought<br />
What the Greek did and what the Florentine?<br />

Ah heavenly joy! But who hath ever heard,<br />
Who hath seen joy, or who shall ever find<br />
Joy's language? There is neither speech nor word;<br />
Nought but itself to teach it to mankind.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Scarce in our twenty thousand painful days</span><br />
We may touch something: but there lives&mdash;beyond<br />
The best of art, or nature's kindest phase&mdash;<br />
The hope whereof our spirit is fain and fond:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The cause of beauty given to man's desires</span><br />
Writ in the expectancy of starry skies,<br />
The faith which gloweth in our fleeting fires,<br />
The aim of all the good that here we prize;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which but to love, pursue and pray for well</span><br />
Maketh earth heaven, and to forget it, hell.<br />

My wearied heart, whenever, after all,<br />
Its loves and yearnings shall be told complete,<br />
When gentle death shall bid it cease to beat,<br />
And from all dear illusions disenthrall:<br />
However then thou shalt appear to call<br />
My fearful heart, since down at others' feet<br />
It bade me kneel so oft, I'll not retreat<br />
From thee, nor fear before thy feet to fall.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I shall say, 'Receive this loving heart</span><br />
Which err'd in sorrow only; and in sin<br />
Took no delight; but being forced apart<br />
From thee, without thee hoping thee to win,<br />
Most prized what most thou madest as thou art<br />
On earth, till heaven were open to enter in.'<br />

Dreary was winter, wet with changeful sting<br />
Of clinging snowfall and fast-flying frost;<br />
And bitterer northwinds then withheld the spring,<br />
That dallied with her promise till 'twas lost.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A sunless and half-hearted summer drown'd</span><br />
The flowers in needful and unwelcom'd rain;<br />
And Autumn with a sad smile fled uncrown'd<br />
From fruitless orchards and unripen'd grain.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But coud the skies of this most desolate year</span><br />
In its last month learn with our love to glow,<br />
Men yet should rank its cloudless atmosphere<br />
Above the sunsets of five years ago:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of my great praise too part should be its own,</span><br />
Now reckon'd peerless for thy love alone.<br />

Away now, lovely Muse, roam and be free:<br />
Our commerce ends for aye, thy task is done:<br />
Tho' to win thee I left all else unwon,<br />
Thou, whom I most have won, art not for me.<br />
My first desire, thou too forgone must be,<br />
Thou too, O much lamented now, tho' none<br />
Will turn to pity thy forsaken son,<br />
Nor thy divine sisters will weep for thee.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">None will weep for thee: thou return, O Muse,</span><br />
To thy Sicilian fields: I once have been<br />
On thy loved hills, and where thou first didst use<br />
Thy sweetly balanced rhyme, O thankless queen,<br />
Have pluck'd and wreath'd thy flowers; but do thou choose<br />
Some happier brow to wear thy garlands green.<br />

Eternal Father, who didst all create,<br />
In whom we live, and to whose bosom move,<br />
To all men be Thy name known, which is Love,<br />
Till its loud praises sound at heaven's high gate.<br />
Perfect Thy kingdom in our passing state,<br />
That here on earth Thou may'st as well approve<br />
Our service, as Thou ownest theirs above,<br />
Whose joy we echo and in pain await.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Grant body and soul each day their daily bread:</span><br />
And should in spite of grace fresh woe begin,<br />
Even as our anger soon is past and dead<br />
Be Thy remembrance mortal of our sin:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By Thee in paths of peace Thy sheep be led,</span><br />
And in the vale of terror comforted.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 12%">ELEGY</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
Clear and gentle stream!<br />
Known and loved so long,<br />
That hast heard the song<br />
And the idle dream<br />
Of my boyish day;<br />
While I once again<br />
Down thy margin stray,<br />
In the selfsame strain<br />
Still my voice is spent,<br />
With my old lament<br />
And my idle dream,<br />
Clear and gentle stream!<br />
<br />
Where my old seat was<br />
Here again I sit,<br />
Where the long boughs knit<br />
Over stream and grass<br />
A translucent eaves:<a name="page_226" id="page_226"></a><span class="pagenumb">{226}</span><br />
Where back eddies play<br />
Shipwreck with the leaves,<br />
And the proud swans stray,<br />
Sailing one by one<br />
Out of stream and sun,<br />
And the fish lie cool<br />
In their chosen pool.<br />
<br />
Many an afternoon<br />
Of the summer day<br />
Dreaming here I lay;<br />
And I know how soon,<br />
Idly at its hour,<br />
First the deep bell hums<br />
From the minster tower,<br />
And then evening comes,<br />
Creeping up the glade,<br />
With her lengthening shade,<br />
And the tardy boon<br />
Of her brightening moon.<br />
<br />
Clear and gentle stream!<br />
Ere again I go<br />
Where thou dost not flow,<br />
Well does it beseem<br />
Thee to hear again<br />
Once my youthful song,<br />
That familiar strain<br />
Silent now so long:<br />
Be as I content<br />
With my old lament<br />
And my idle dream,<br />
Clear and gentle stream.<br />&nbsp; <br />

<p class="poem20">
<span style="margin-left: 15%">2</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
<span style="margin-left: 12%">ELEGY</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
The wood is bare: a river-mist is steeping<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The trees that winter's chill of life bereaves:</span><br />
Only their stiffened boughs break silence, weeping<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Over their fallen leaves;</span><br />
<br />
That lie upon the dank earth brown and rotten,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Miry and matted in the soaking wet:</span><br />
Forgotten with the spring, that is forgotten<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">By them that can forget.</span><br />
<br />
Yet it was here we walked when ferns were springing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And through the mossy bank shot bud and blade:-</span><br />
Here found in summer, when the birds were singing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">A green and pleasant shade.</span><br />
<br />
'Twas here we loved in sunnier days and greener;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now, in this disconsolate decay,</span><br />
I come to see her where I most have seen her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And touch the happier day.</span><br />
<br />
For on this path, at every turn and corner,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fancy of her figure on me falls;</span><br />
Yet walks she with the slow step of a mourner,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Nor hears my voice that calls.</span><br />
<br />
So through my heart there winds a track of feeling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A path of memory, that is all her own:</span><br />
Whereto her phantom beauty ever stealing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Haunts the sad spot alone.</span><br />
<br />
About her steps the trunks are bare, the branches<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drip heavy tears upon her downcast head;</span><br />
And bleed from unseen wounds that no sun stanches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For the year's sun is dead.<a name="page_228" id="page_228"></a><span class="pagenumb">{228}</span></span><br />
<br />
And dead leaves wrap the fruits that summer planted:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And birds that love the South have taken wing.</span><br />
The wanderer, loitering o'er the scene enchanted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Weeps, and despairs of spring.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem25">
<span style="margin-left: 15%">3</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
Poor withered rose and dry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Skeleton of a rose,</span><br />
Risen to testify<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To love's sad close:</span><br />
<br />
Treasured for love's sweet sake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That of joy past</span><br />
Thou might'st again awake<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Memory at last.</span><br />
<br />
Yet is thy perfume sweet;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy petals red</span><br />
Yet tell of summer heat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the gay bed:</span><br />
<br />
Yet, yet recall the glow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the gazing sun,</span><br />
When at thy bush we two<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Joined hands in one.</span><br />
<br />
But, rose, thou hast not seen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou hast not wept</span><br />
The change that passed between,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whilst thou hast slept.</span><br />
<br />
To me thou seemest yet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dead dream's thrall:</span><br />
While I live and forget<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dream, truth and all.</span><br />
<br />
Thou art more fresh than I,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rose, sweet and red:</span><br />
Salt on my pale cheeks lie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tears I shed.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 15%">4</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
<span style="margin-left: 10%">THE CLIFF-TOP</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
The cliff-top has a carpet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of lilac, gold and green:</span><br />
The blue sky bounds the ocean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The white clouds scud between.</span><br />
<br />
A flock of gulls are wheeling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wailing round my seat;</span><br />
Above my head the heaven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sea beneath my feet.</span><br />
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%">THE OCEAN.</span><br />&nbsp; <br />

Were I a cloud I'd gather<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My skirts up in the air,</span><br />
And fly I well know whither,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rest I well know where.</span><br />
<br />
As pointed the star surely,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The legend tells of old,</span><br />
Where the wise kings might offer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Myrrh, frankincense, and gold;</span><br />
<br />
Above the house I'd hover<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where dwells my love, and wait</span><br />
Till haply I might spy her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Throw back the garden-gate.</span><br />
<br />
There in the summer evening<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I would bedeck the moon;</span><br />
I would float down and screen her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the sun's rays at noon;</span><br />
<br />
And if her flowers should languish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or wither in the drought</span><br />
Upon her tall white lilies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd pour my heart's blood out:<a name="page_230" id="page_230"></a><span class="pagenumb">{230}</span></span><br />
<br />
So if she wore one only,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shook not out the rain,</span><br />
Were I a cloud, O cloudlet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I had not lived in vain.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="r">[<i>A cloud speaks.</i></p>

<p class="poem25">
<span style="margin-left: 12%">A CLOUD.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />
But were I thou, O ocean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I would not chafe and fret</span><br />
As thou, because a limit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To thy desires is set.</span><br />
<br />
I would be blue, and gentle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Patient, and calm, and see</span><br />
If my smiles might not tempt her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My love, to come to me.</span><br />
<br />
I'd make my depths transparent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And still, that she should lean</span><br />
O'er the boat's edge to ponder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sights that swam between.</span><br />
<br />
I would command strange creatures,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of bright hue and quick fin,</span><br />
To stir the water near her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tempt her bare arm in.</span><br />
<br />
I'd teach her spend the summer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With me: and I can tell,</span><br />
That, were I thou, O ocean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My love should love me well.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 8%">*</span> <span style="margin-left: 8%">*</span> <span style="margin-left: 8%">*</span><br />
<br />
But on the mad cloud scudded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The breeze it blew so stiff;</span><br />
And the sad ocean bellowed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pounded at the cliff.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />

I heard a linnet courting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His lady in the spring:</span><br />
His mates were idly sporting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor stayed to hear him sing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His song of love.&mdash;</span><br />
I fear my speech distorting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His tender love.</span><br />
<br />
The phrases of his pleading<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were full of young delight;</span><br />
And she that gave him heeding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Interpreted aright</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His gay, sweet notes,&mdash;</span><br />
So sadly marred in the reading,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His tender notes.</span><br />
<br />
And when he ceased, the hearer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Awaited the refrain,</span><br />
Till swiftly perching nearer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He sang his song again,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His pretty song:&mdash;</span><br />
Would that my verse spake clearer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His tender song!</span><br />
<br />
Ye happy, airy creatures!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That in the merry spring</span><br />
Think not of what misfeatures<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or cares the year may bring;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But unto love</span><br />
Resign your simple natures,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To tender love.</span><br />

Dear lady, when thou frownest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my true love despisest,</span><br />
And all thy vows disownest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sealed my venture wisest;</span><br />
I think thy pride's displeasure<br />
Neglects a matchless treasure<br />
Exceeding price and measure.<br />
<br />
But when again thou smilest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And love for love returnest,</span><br />
And fear with joy beguilest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And takest truth in earnest;</span><br />
Then, though I sheer adore thee,<br />
The sum of my love for thee<br />
Seems poor, scant, and unworthy.<br />

Ends all our month-long love in this?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Can it be summed up so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Quit in a single kiss?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I will not let thee go.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I will not let thee go.</span><br />
If thy words' breath could scare thy deeds,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And toss the feathered seeds,</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I will not let thee go.</span><br />
Had not the great sun seen, I might;<br />

The stars that crowd the summer skies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Have watched us so below</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With all their million eyes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I dare not let thee go.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I will not let thee go.</span><br />
Have we not chid the changeful moon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now rising late, and now</span><br />

I found to-day out walking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The flower my love loves best.</span><br />
What, when I stooped to pluck it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could dare my hand arrest?</span><br />
<br />
Was it a snake lay curling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About the root's thick crown?</span><br />
Or did some hidden bramble<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tear my hand reaching down?</span><br />
<br />
There was no snake uncurling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no thorn wounded me;</span><br />
'Twas my heart checked me, sighing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She is beyond the sea.</span><br />

A poppy grows upon the shore,<br />
Bursts her twin cup in summer late:<br />
Her leaves are glaucous-green and hoar,<br />
Her petals yellow, delicate.<br />
<br />
Oft to her cousins turns her thought,<br />
In wonder if they care that she<br />
Is fed with spray for dew, and caught<br />
By every gale that sweeps the sea.<br />
<br />
She has no lovers like the red,<br />
That dances with the noble corn:<br />
Her blossoms on the waves are shed,<br />
Where she stands shivering and forlorn.<br />

Long are the hours the sun is above,<br />
But when evening comes I go home to my love.<br />
<br />
I'm away the daylight hours and more,<br />
Yet she comes not down to open the door.<br />
<br />
She does not meet me upon the stair,&mdash;<br />
She sits in my chamber and waits for me there.<br />
<br />
As I enter the room she does not move:<br />
I always walk straight up to my love;<br />
<br />
And she lets me take my wonted place<br />
At her side, and gaze in her dear dear face.<br />
<br />
There as I sit, from her head thrown back<br />
Her hair falls straight in a shadow black.<br />
<br />
Aching and hot as my tired eyes be,<br />
She is all that I wish to see.<br />
<br />
And in my wearied and toil-dinned ear,<br />
She says all things that I wish to hear.<br />
<br />
Dusky and duskier grows the room,<br />
Yet I see her best in the darker gloom.<br />
<br />
When the winter eves are early and cold,<br />
The firelight hours are a dream of gold.<br />
<br />
And so I sit here night by night,<br />
In rest and enjoyment of love's delight.<br />
<br />
But a knock at the door, a step on the stair<br />
Will startle, alas, my love from her chair.<br />
<br />
If a stranger comes she will not stay:<br />
At the first alarm she is off and away.<br />
<br />
And he wonders, my guest, usurping her throne,<br />
That I sit so much by myself alone.<br />

And who does not the morning know,<br />
The day the angry gale is o'er,<br />
The hour the wind has ceased to blow?<br />

The horses of the strong south-west<br />
Are pastured round his tropic tent,<br />
Careless how long the ocean's breast<br />
Sob on and sigh for passion spent.<br />

To house in rock and tower and tree,<br />
Are gathering on the peaceful strand,<br />
To tempt again the sunny sea;<br />

Whereon the timid ships steal out<br />
And laugh to find their foe asleep,<br />
That lately scattered them about,<br />
And drave them to the fold like sheep.<br />
<br />
The snow-white clouds he northward chased<br />
Break into phalanx, line, and band:<br />
All one way to the south they haste,<br />
The south, their pleasant fatherland.<br />
<br />
From distant hills their shadows creep,<br />
Arrive in turn and mount the lea,<br />
And flit across the downs, and leap<br />
Sheer off the cliff upon the sea;<br />
<br />
And sail and sail far out of sight.<br />
But still I watch their fleecy trains,<br />

Assemble, all ye maidens, at the door,<br />
And all ye loves, assemble; far and wide<br />
Proclaim the bridal, that proclaimed before<br />
Has been deferred to this late eventide:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For on this night the bride,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The days of her betrothal over,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leaves the parental hearth for evermore;</span><br />
To-night the bride goes forth to meet her lover.<br />
<br />
Reach down the wedding vesture, that has lain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet all unvisited, the silken gown:</span><br />
Bring out the bracelets, and the golden chain<br />
Her dearer friends provided: sere and brown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bring out the festal crown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And set it on her forehead lightly:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though it be withered, twine no wreath again;</span><br />
This only is the crown she can wear rightly.<br />
<br />
Cloke her in ermine, for the night is cold,<br />
And wrap her warmly, for the night is long,<br />
In pious hands the flaming torches hold,<br />
While her attendants, chosen from among<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Her faithful virgin throng,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">May lay her in her cedar litter,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Decking her coverlet with sprigs of gold,</span><br />
Roses, and lilies white that best befit her.<a name="page_239" id="page_239"></a><span class="pagenumb">{239}</span><br />
<br />
Sound flute and tabor, that the bridal be<br />
Not without music, nor with these alone;<br />
But let the viol lead the melody,<br />
With lesser intervals, and plaintive moan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of sinking semitone;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, all in choir, the virgin voices</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rest not from singing in skilled harmony</span><br />
The song that aye the bridegroom's ear rejoices.<br />
<br />
Let the priests go before, arrayed in white,<br />
And let the dark-stoled minstrels follow slow,<br />
Next they that bear her, honoured on this night,<br />
And then the maidens, in a double row,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Each singing soft and low,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And each on high a torch upstaying:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unto her lover lead her forth with light,</span><br />
With music, and with singing, and with praying.<br />
<br />
'Twas at this sheltering hour he nightly came,<br />
And found her trusty window open wide,<br />
And knew the signal of the timorous flame,<br />
That long the restless curtain would not hide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Her form that stood beside;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As scarce she dared to be delighted,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Listening to that sweet tale, that is no shame</span><br />
To faithful lovers, that their hearts have plighted.<br />
<br />
But now for many days the dewy grass<br />
Has shown no markings of his feet at morn:<br />
And watching she has seen no shadow pass<br />
The moonlit walk, and heard no music borne<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Upon her ear forlorn.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In vain has she looked out to greet him;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He has not come, he will not come, alas!</span><br />
So let us bear her out where she must meet him.<a name="page_240" id="page_240"></a><span class="pagenumb">{240}</span><br />

Now to the river bank the priests are come:<br />
The bark is ready to receive its freight:<br />

Embark the litter with its slender weight:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The rest stand by in state,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sing her a safe passage over;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While she is oared across to her new home,</span><br />
Into the arms of her expectant lover.<br />
<br />
And thou, O lover, that art on the watch,<br />
Where, on the banks of the forgetful streams,<br />
The pale indifferent ghosts wander, and snatch<br />
The sweeter moments of their broken dreams,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Thou, when the torchlight gleams,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When thou shalt see the slow procession,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when thine ears the fitful music catch,</span><br />
Rejoice, for thou art near to thy possession.<br />&nbsp; <br />

I saw the Virgin-mother clad in green,<br />
Walking the sprinkled meadows at sundown;<br />
While yet the moon's cold flame was hung between<br />
The day and night, above the dusky town:<br />
I saw her brighter than the Western gold,<br />
Whereto she faced in splendour to behold.<br />
<br />
Her dress was greener than the tenderest leaf<br />
That trembled in the sunset glare aglow:<br />
Herself more delicate than is the brief,<br />
Pink apple-blossom, that May showers lay low,<br />
And more delicious than 's the earliest streak<br />
The blushing rose shows of her crimson cheek.<br />
<br />
As if to match the sight that so did please,<br />
A music entered, making passion fain:<br />
Three nightingales sat singing in the trees,<br />
And praised the Goddess for the fallen rain;<br />
Which yet their unseen motions did arouse,<br />
Or parting Zephyrs shook out from the boughs.<br />
<br />
And o'er the treetops, scattered in mid air,<br />
The exhausted clouds laden with crimson light<br />
Floated, or seemed to sleep; and, highest there,<br />
One planet broke the lingering ranks of night;<br />
Daring day's company, so he might spy<br />
The Virgin-queen once with his watchful eye.<a name="page_246" id="page_246"></a><span class="pagenumb">{246}</span><br />

And when I saw her, then I worshipped her,<br />

Mother of all my years, thou who dost stir<br />
My heart to adore thee and my tongue to sing,<br />
Flower of my fruit, of my heart's blood the fire,<br />
Of all my satisfaction the desire!<br />
<br />
How art thou every year more beautiful,<br />
Younger for all the winters thou hast cast:<br />
And I, for all my love grows, grow more dull,<br />
Decaying with each season overpast!<br />
In vain to teach him love must man employ thee,<br />
The more he learns the less he can enjoy thee.<br />&nbsp; <br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Go free, since go thou must:&mdash;</span><br />
And so farewell I bid her.<br />

Shady with birch and beech and odorous pine:<br />
And brilliant underfoot with thousand gems<br />
Steeply the thickets to his floods decline.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Straight trees in every place</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Their thick tops interlace,</span><br />
And pendant branches trail their foliage fine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon his watery face.</span><br />
<br />
Swift from the sweltering pasturage he flows:<br />
His stream, alert to seek the pleasant shade,<br />
Pictures his gentle purpose, as he goes<br />
Straight to the caverned pool his toil has made.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His winter floods lay bare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The stout roots in the air:</span><br />
His summer streams are cool, when they have played<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Among their fibrous hair.</span><br />
<br />
A rushy island guards the sacred bower,<br />
And hides it from the meadow, where in peace<br />
The lazy cows wrench many a scented flower,<br />
Robbing the golden market of the bees:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And laden barges float</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By banks of myosote;</span><br />
And scented flag and golden flower-de-lys<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Delay the loitering boat.</span><br />
<br />
And on this side the island, where the pool<br />
Eddies away, are tangled mass on mass<br />
The water-weeds, that net the fishes cool,<br />
And scarce allow a narrow stream to pass;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where spreading crowfoot mars</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The drowning nenuphars,</span><br />
Waving the tassels of her silken grass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Below her silver stars.<a name="page_249" id="page_249"></a><span class="pagenumb">{249}</span></span><br />
<br />
But in the purple pool there nothing grows,<br />
Not the white water-lily spoked with gold;<br />
Though best she loves the hollows, and well knows<br />
On quiet streams her broad shields to unfold:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet should her roots but try</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Within these deeps to lie,</span><br />
Not her long reaching stalk could ever hold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her waxen head so high.</span><br />
<br />
Sometimes an angler comes, and drops his hook<br />
Within its hidden depths, and 'gainst a tree<br />
Leaning his rod, reads in some pleasant book,<br />
Forgetting soon his pride of fishery;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And dreams, or falls asleep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While curious fishes peep</span><br />
About his nibbled bait, or scornfully<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dart off and rise and leap.</span><br />
<br />
And sometimes a slow figure 'neath the trees,<br />
In ancient-fashioned smock, with tottering care<br />
Upon a staff propping his weary knees,<br />
May by the pathway of the forest fare:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As from a buried day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Across the mind will stray</span><br />
Some perishing mute shadow,&mdash;and unaware<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He passeth on his way.</span><br />
<br />
Else, he that wishes solitude is safe,<br />
Whether he bathe at morning in the stream:<br />
Or lead his love there when the hot hours chafe<br />
The meadows, busy with a blurring steam;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or watch, as fades the light,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The gibbous moon grow bright,</span><br />
Until her  magic rays dance in a dream,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And glorify the night.<a name="page_250" id="page_250"></a><span class="pagenumb">{250}</span></span><br />
<br />
Where is this bower beside the silver Thames?<br />
O pool and flowery thickets, hear my vow!<br />
O trees of freshest foliage and straight stems,<br />
No sharer of my secret I allow:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lest ere I come the while</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Strange feet your shades defile;</span><br />
Or lest the burly oarsman turn his prow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Within your guardian isle.</span><br />&nbsp; <br />

Let us, as by this verdant bank we float,<br />
Search down the marge to find some shady pool<br />
Where we may rest awhile and moor our boat,<br />
And bathe our tired limbs in the waters cool.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Beneath the noonday sun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Swiftly, O river, run!</span><br />
<br />
Here is a mirror for Narcissus, see!<br />
I cannot sound it, plumbing with my oar.<br />
Lay the stern in beneath this bowering tree!<br />
Now, stepping on this stump, we are ashore.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Guard, Hamadryades,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Our clothes laid by your trees!</span><br />
<br />
How the birds warble in the woods! I pick<br />
The waxen lilies, diving to the root.<br />
But swim not far in the stream, the weeds grow thick,<br />
And hot on the bare head the sunbeams shoot.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Until our sport be done,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">O merry birds, sing on!</span><br />
<br />
If but to-night the sky be clear, the moon<br />
Will serve us well, for she is near the full.<br />
We shall row safely home; only too soon,&mdash;<br />
So pleasant 'tis, whether we float or pull.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To guide us through the night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">O summer moon, shine bright!</span><br />&nbsp; <br />

O bold majestic downs, smooth, fair and lonely;<br />
O still solitude, only matched in the skies:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Perilous in steep places,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Soft in the level races,</span><br />
Where sweeping in phantom silence the cloudland flies;<br />
With lovely undulation of fall and rise;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Entrenched with thickets thorned,</span><br />
By delicate miniature dainty flowers adorned!<br />
<br />
I climb your crown, and lo! a sight surprising<br />
Of sea in front uprising, steep and wide:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And scattered ships ascending</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To heaven, lost in the blending</span><br />
Of distant blues, where water and sky divide,<br />
Urging their engines against wind and tide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all so small and slow</span><br />
They seem to be wearily pointing the way they would go.<br />
<br />
The accumulated murmur of soft plashing,<br />
Of waves on rocks dashing and searching the sands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Takes my ear, in the veering</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Baffled wind, as rearing</span><br />
Upright at the cliff, to the gullies and rifts he stands;<br />
And his conquering surges scour out over the lands;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While again at the foot of the downs</span><br />
He masses his strength to recover the topmost crowns.<br />&nbsp; <br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Again with pleasant green</span><br />
Has Spring renewed the wood,<br />
And where the bare trunks stood<br />
Are leafy arbours seen;<br />
And back on budding boughs<br />
Come birds, to court and pair,<br />
Whose rival amorous vows<br />
Amaze the scented air.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The freshets are unbound,</span><br />
And leaping from the hill,<br />
Their mossy banks refill<br />
With streams of light and sound:<br />
And scattered down the meads,<br />
From hour to hour unfold<br />
A thousand buds and beads<br />
In stars and cups of gold.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now hear, and see, and note,</span><br />
The farms are all astir,<br />
And every labourer<br />
Has doffed his winter coat;<br />
And how with specks of white<br />
They dot the brown hillside,<br />
Or jaunt and sing outright<br />
As by their teams they stride.<a name="page_253" id="page_253"></a><span class="pagenumb">{253}</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They sing to feel the Sun</span><br />
Regain his wanton strength;<br />
To know the year at length<br />
Rewards their labour done;<br />
To see the rootless stake<br />
They set bare in the ground,<br />
Burst into leaf, and shake<br />
Its grateful scent around.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah now an evil lot</span><br />
Is his, who toils for gain,<br />
Where crowded chimneys stain<br />
The heavens his choice forgot;<br />
'Tis on the blighted trees<br />
That deck his garden dim,<br />
And in the tainted breeze,<br />
That sweet Spring comes to him.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far sooner I would choose</span><br />
The life of brutes that bask,<br />
Than set myself a task,<br />
Which inborn powers refuse:<br />
And rather far enjoy<br />
The body, than invent<br />
A duty, to destroy<br />
The ease which nature sent;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And country life I praise,</span><br />
And lead, because I find<br />
The philosophic mind<br />
Can take no middle ways;<br />
She will not leave her love<br />
To mix with men, her art<br />
Is all to strive above<br />
The crowd, or stand apart.<a name="page_254" id="page_254"></a><span class="pagenumb">{254}</span><br />

Hell underfoot, and won<br />
A crown from man and God<br />
For all that he has done.&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That highest gift of all,</span><br />
Since crabbÃ¨d fate did flood<br />
My heart with sluggish blood,<br />
I look not mine to call;<br />
But, like a truant freed,<br />
Fly to the woods, and claim<br />
A pleasure for the deed<br />
Of my inglorious name:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And am content, denied</span><br />
The best, in choosing right;<br />
For Nature can delight<br />
Fancies unoccupied<br />
With ecstasies so sweet<br />
As none can even guess,<br />
Who walk not with the feet<br />
Of joy in idleness.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then leave your joyless ways,</span><br />
My friend, my joys to see.<br />
The day you come shall be<br />
The choice of chosen days:<br />
You shall be lost, and learn<br />
New being, and forget<br />
The world, till your return<br />
Shall bring your first regret.<br />&nbsp; <br />

In splendour decked anew,<br />
Down from her heaven of blue<br />
Returns on sunlit wing:<br />
The zephyrs of her train<br />
In fleecy clouds disport,<br />
And birds to greet her reign<br />
Summon their silvan court.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And here in street and square</span><br />
The prisoned trees contest<br />
Her favour with the best,<br />
To robe themselves full fair:<br />
And forth their buds provoke,<br />
Forgetting winter brown,<br />
And all the mire and smoke<br />
That wrapped the dingy town.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now he that loves indeed</span><br />
His pleasure must awake,<br />
Lest any pleasure take<br />
Its flight, and he not heed;<br />
For of his few short years<br />
Another now invites<br />
His hungry soul, and cheers<br />
His life with new delights.<a name="page_256" id="page_256"></a><span class="pagenumb">{256}</span><br />

Has taught and skilled his heart<br />
To read her skill and lore?<br />
Whose spirit leaps more high,<br />
Plucking the pale primrose,<br />
Than his whose feet must fly<br />
The pasture where it grows?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One long in city pent</span><br />
Forgets, or must complain:<br />
But think not I can stain<br />
My heaven with discontent;<br />
Nor wallow with that sad,<br />
Backsliding herd, who cry<br />
That Truth must make man bad,<br />
And pleasure is a lie.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rather while Reason lives</span><br />
To mark me from the beast,<br />
I'll teach her serve at least<br />
To heal the wound she gives:<br />
Nor need she strain her powers<br />
Beyond a common flight,<br />
To make the passing hours<br />
Happy from morn till night.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since health our toil rewards,</span><br />
And strength is labour's prize,<br />
I hate not, nor despise<br />
The work my lot accords;<br />
Nor fret with fears unkind<br />
The tender joys, that bless<br />
My hard-won peace of mind,<br />
In hours of idleness.<a name="page_257" id="page_257"></a><span class="pagenumb">{257}</span><br />

Can give, know I,&mdash;if wine<br />
Go round, or throats combine<br />
To set dumb music free.<br />
Or deep in wintertide<br />
When winds without make moan,<br />
I love my own fireside<br />
Not least when most alone.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then oft I turn the page</span><br />
In which our country's name,<br />
Spoiling the Greek of fame,<br />
Shall sound in every age:<br />
Or some Terentian play<br />
Renew, whose excellent<br />
Adjusted folds betray<br />
How once Menander went.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or if grave study suit</span><br />
The yet unwearied brain,<br />
Plato can teach again,<br />
And Socrates dispute;<br />
Till fancy in a dream<br />
Confront their souls with mine,<br />
Crowning the mind supreme,<br />
And her delights divine.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While pleasure yet can be</span><br />
Pleasant, and fancy sweet,<br />
I bid all care retreat<br />
From my philosophy;<br />
Which, when I come to try<br />
Your simpler life, will find,<br />
I doubt not, joys to vie<br />
With those I leave behind.<br />&nbsp; <br />

I come, unquiet sorrows to control;<br />
Amid thy silent mossgrown graves to muse<br />
With my neglected solitary soul;<br />
And to poetic sadness care confide,<br />
Trusting sweet Melancholy for my guide:<br />
<br />
They will not ask why in thy shades I stray,<br />
Among the tombs finding my rare delight,<br />
Beneath the sun at indolent noonday,<br />
Or in the windy moon-enchanted night,<br />
Who have once reined in their steeds at any shrine,<br />
And given them water from the well divine.&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The orchards are all ripened, and the sun</span><br />
Spots the deserted gleanings with decay;<br />
The seeds are perfected: his work is done,<br />
And Autumn lingers but to outsmile the May;<br />
Bidding his tinted leaves glide, bidding clear<br />
Unto clear skies the birds applaud the year.<br />
<br />
Lo, here I sit, and to the world I call,<br />
The world my solemn fancy leaves behind,<br />
Come! pass within the inviolable wall,<br />
Come pride, come pleasure, come distracted mind;<br />
Within the fated refuge, hither, turn,<br />
And learn your wisdom ere 'tis late to learn.<br />
<br />
Come with me now, and taste the fount of tears;<br />
For many eyes have sanctified this spot,<br />
Where grief's unbroken lineage endears<br />
The charm untimely Folly injures not,<br />
And slays the intruding thoughts, that overleap<br />
The simple fence its holiness doth keep.<br />
<br />
Read the worn names of the forgotten dead,<br />
Their pompous legends will no smile awake;<br />
Even the vainglorious title o'er the head<br />
Wins its pride pardon for its sorrow's sake;<br />
And carven Loves scorn not their dusty prize,<br />
Though fallen so far from tender sympathies.<br />
<br />
Here where a mother laid her only son,<br />
Here where a lover left his bride, below<br />
The treasured names their own are added on<br />
To those whom they have followed long ago:<br />
Sealing the record of the tears they shed,<br />
That 'where their treasure there their hearts are fled.'<br />
<br />
Grandfather, father, son, and then again<br />
Child, grandchild, and great-grandchild laid beneath<br />
Numbered in turn among the sons of men,<br />
And gathered each one in his turn to death:<br />
While he that occupies their house and name<br />
To-day,&mdash;to-morrow too their grave shall claim.<br />
<br />
And where are all the spirits? Ah! could we tell<br />
The manner of our being when we die,<br />
And see beyond the scene we know so well,<br />
The country that so much obscured doth lie!<br />
With brightest visions our fond hopes repair,<br />
Or crown our melancholy with despair;<br />
<br />
From death, still death, still would a comfort come:<br />
Since of this world the essential joy must fall<br />
In all distributed, in each thing some,<br />
In nothing all, and all complete in all;<br />
Till pleasure, ageing to her full increase,<br />
Puts on perfection, and is throned in peace.<a name="page_259" id="page_259"></a><span class="pagenumb">{259}</span><br />
<br />
Yea, sweetest peace, unsought-for, undesired,<br />
Loathed and misnamed, 'tis thee I worship here:<br />
Though in most black habiliments attired,<br />
Thou art sweet peace, and thee I cannot fear.<br />
Nay, were my last hope quenched, I here would sit<br />
And praise the annihilation of the pit.<br />
<br />
Nor quickly disenchanted will my feet<br />
Back to the busy town return, but yet<br />
Linger, ere I my loving friends would greet,<br />
Or touch their hands, or share without regret<br />
The warmth of that kind hearth, whose sacred ties<br />
Only shall dim with tears my dying eyes.<br />&nbsp; <br />

The fires, devour my soul that once was whole:<br />

These vague desires, these leaping flames of the soul:<br />
Could I but quench the fire: ah! could I stay<br />

<span style="margin-left: 12%">LONDON SNOW</span><br />&nbsp; <br />

When men were all asleep the snow came flying,<br />
In large white flakes falling on the city brown,<br />
Stealthily and perpetually settling and loosely lying,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hushing the latest traffic of the drowsy town;</span><br />
Deadening, muffling, stifling its murmurs failing;<br />
Lazily and incessantly floating down and down:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Silently sifting and veiling road, roof and railing;</span><br />
Hiding difference, making unevenness even,<br />
Into angles and crevices softly drifting and sailing.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All night it fell, and when full inches seven</span><br />
It lay in the depth of its uncompacted lightness,<br />
The clouds blew off from a high and frosty heaven;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all woke earlier for the unaccustomed brightness</span><br />
Of the winter dawning, the strange unheavenly glare:<br />
The eye marvelled&mdash;marvelled at the dazzling whiteness;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ear hearkened to the stillness of the solemn air;</span><br />
No sound of wheel rumbling nor of foot falling,<br />
And the busy morning cries came thin and spare.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then boys I heard, as they went to school, calling,</span><br />
They gathered up the crystal manna to freeze<br />
Their tongues with tasting, their hands with snowballing;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or rioted in a drift, plunging up to the knees;</span><br />
Or peering up from under the white-mossed wonder,<br />
'O look at the trees!' they cried, 'O look at the trees!'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With lessened load a few carts creak and blunder,</span><br />
Following along the white deserted way,<br />
A country company long dispersed asunder:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When now already the sun, in pale display</span><br />
Standing by Paul's high dome, spread forth below<br />
His sparkling beams, and awoke the stir of the day.<a name="page_266" id="page_266"></a><span class="pagenumb">{266}</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For now doors open, and war is waged with the snow;</span><br />
And trains of sombre men, past tale of number,<br />
Tread long brown paths, as toward their toil they go:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But even for them awhile no cares encumber</span><br />
Their minds diverted; the daily word is unspoken,<br />
The daily thoughts of labour and sorrow slumber<br />
At the sight of the beauty that greets them, for the charm they have broken.<br />&nbsp;<br />

I stand on the cliff and watch the veiled sun paling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A silver field afar in the mournful sea,</span><br />
The scourge of the surf, and plaintive gulls sailing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At ease on the gale that smites the shuddering lea:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Whose smile severe and chaste</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">June never hath stirred to vanity, nor age defaced.</span><br />
In lofty thought strive, O spirit, for ever:<br />
In courage and strength pursue thine own endeavour.<br />
<br />
Ah! if it were only for thee, thou restless ocean<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of waves that follow and roar, the sweep of the tides;</span><br />
Wer't only for thee, impetuous wind, whose motion<br />

O well should I understand the voice of Nature.<br />

But far away, I think, in the Thames valley,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The silent river glides by flowery banks:</span><br />
And birds sing sweetly in branches that arch an alley<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of cloistered trees, moss-grown in their ancient ranks:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Where if a light air stray,</span><br />

Serve thy sweet desire: despise endeavour.<br />
<br />
And if it were only for thee, entrancÃ¨d river,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That scarce dost rock the lily on her airy stem,</span><br />
Or stir a wave to murmur, or a rush to quiver;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wer't but for the woods, and summer asleep in them:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">For you my bowers green,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Startling my fancy fond</span><br />

So quiet! doth the change content thee?&mdash;Death, whither hath he taken thee?<br />

Ah! little at best can all our hopes avail us<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%">INDOLENCE</span><br />&nbsp; <br />

We left the city when the summer day<br />
Had verged already on its hot decline,<br />
And charmÃ¨d Indolence in languor lay<br />
In her gay gardens, 'neath her towers divine:<br />
'Farewell,' we said, 'dear city of youth and dream!'<br />
And in our boat we stepped and took the stream.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All through that idle afternoon we strayed</span><br />
Upon our proposed travel well begun,<br />
As loitering by the woodland's dreamy shade,<br />
Past shallow islets floating in the sun,<br />
Or searching down the banks for rarer flowers<br />
We lingered out the pleasurable hours.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till when that loveliest came, which mowers home</span><br />
Turns from their longest labour, as we steered<br />
Along a straitened channel flecked with foam,<br />
We lost our landscape wide, and slowly neared<br />
An ancient bridge, that like a blind wall lay<br />
Low on its buried vaults to block the way.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then soon the narrow tunnels broader showed,</span><br />
Where with its arches three it sucked the mass<br />
Of water, that in swirl thereunder flowed,<br />
Or stood piled at the piers waiting to pass;<br />
And pulling for the middle span, we drew<br />
The tender blades aboard and floated through.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But past the bridge what change we found below!</span><br />
The stream, that all day long had laughed and played<br />
Betwixt the happy shires, ran dark and slow,<br />
And with its easy flood no murmur made:<br />
And weeds spread on its surface, and about<br />
The stagnant margin reared their stout heads out.<a name="page_271" id="page_271"></a><span class="pagenumb">{271}</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the left high elms, with giant wood</span><br />
Skirting the water-meadows, interwove<br />
Their slumbrous crowns, o'ershadowing where they stood<br />
The floor and heavy pillars of the grove:<br />
And in the shade, through reeds and sedges dank,<br />
A footpath led along the moated bank.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Across, all down the right, an old brick wall,</span><br />
Above and o'er the channel, red did lean;<br />
Here buttressed up, and bulging there to fall,<br />
Tufted with grass and plants and lichen green;<br />
And crumbling to the flood, which at its base<br />
Slid gently nor disturbed its mirrored face.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sheer on the wall the houses rose, their backs</span><br />
All windowless, neglected and awry,<br />
With tottering coigns, and crooked chimney stacks;<br />
And here and there an unused door, set high<br />
Above the fragments of its mouldering stair,<br />
With rail and broken step led out on air.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond, deserted wharfs and vacant sheds,</span><br />
With empty boats and barges moored along,<br />
And rafts half-sunken, fringed with weedy shreds,<br />
And sodden beams, once soaked to season strong.<br />
No sight of man, nor sight of life, no stroke,<br />
No voice the somnolence and silence broke.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then I who rowed leant on my oar, whose drip</span><br />
Fell without sparkle, and I rowed no more;<br />
And he that steered moved neither hand nor lip,<br />
But turned his wondering eye from shore to shore;<br />
And our trim boat let her swift motion die,<br />
Between the dim reflections floating by.<br />&nbsp;<br />

The darkness silvers away, the morn doth break,<br />
It leaps in the sky: unrisen lustres slake<br />
The o'ertaken moon. Awake, O heart, awake!<br />

She too that loveth awaketh and hopes for thee;<br />
Her eyes already have sped the shades that flee,<br />
Already they watch the path thy feet shall take:<br />
Awake, O heart, to be loved, awake, awake!<br />
<br />
And if thou tarry from her,&mdash;if this could be,&mdash;<br />
She cometh herself, O heart, to be loved, to thee;<br />
For thee would unashamÃ¨d herself forsake:<br />
Awake to be loved, my heart, awake, awake!<a name="page_278" id="page_278"></a><span class="pagenumb">{278}</span><br />

Awake, the land is scattered with light, and see,<br />
Uncanopied sleep is flying from field and tree:<br />
And blossoming boughs of April in laughter shake;<br />
Awake, O heart, to be loved, awake, awake!<br />
<br />
Lo all things wake and tarry and look for thee:<br />
She looketh and saith, 'O sun, now bring him to me.<br />
Come more adored, O adored, for his coming's sake,<br />
And awake my heart to be loved: awake, awake!'<br />

I love my lady's eyes<br />
Above the beauties rare<br />
She most is wont to prize,<br />
Above her sunny hair,<br />
And all that face to face<br />
Her glass repeats of grace.<br />
<br />
For those are still the same<br />
To her and all that see:<br />
But oh! her eyes will flame<br />
When they do look on me:<br />
And so above the rest<br />
I love her eyes the best.<br />
<br />
Now say, [<i>Say, O say! saith the music</i>]<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who likes my song?&mdash;<br />
I knew you by your eyes,<br />
That rest on nothing long,<br />
And have forgot surprise;<br />
And stray [<i>Stray, O stray! saith the music</i>]<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as mine will stray,<br />
The while my love's away.<br />

In patient russet is his forest spread,<br />

<br />
The hazel hath put forth his tassels ruffed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The willow's flossy tuft</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hath slipped him free:</span><br />
The rose amid her ransacked orange hips<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Braggeth the tender tips</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of bowers to be.</span><br />
<br />
A black rook stirs the branches here and there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Foraging to repair</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His broken home:</span><br />
And hark, on the ash-boughs! Never thrush did sing<br />

The birds that sing on autumn eves<br />
Among the golden-tinted leaves,<br />
Are but the few that true remain<br />
Of budding May's rejoicing train.<br />
<br />
Like autumn flowers that brave the frost,<br />
And make their show when hope is lost,<br />
These 'mong the fruits and mellow scent<br />
Mourn not the high-sunned summer spent.<br />
<br />
Their notes thro' all the jocund spring<br />
Were mixed in merry musicking:<br />
They sang for love the whole day long,<br />
But now their love is all for song.<br />
<br />
Now each hath perfected his lay<br />
To praise the year that hastes away:<br />
They sit on boughs apart, and vie<br />
In single songs and rich reply:<br />
<br />
And oft as in the copse I hear<br />
These anthems of the dying year,<br />
The passions, once her peace that stole,<br />
With flattering love my heart console.<br />&nbsp;<br />

When my love was away,<br />
Full three days were not sped,<br />
I caught my fancy astray<br />
Thinking if she were dead,<br />
<br />
And I alone, alone:<br />
It seemed in my misery<br />
In all the world was none<br />
Ever so lone as I.<br />
<br />
I wept; but it did not shame<br />
Nor comfort my heart: away<br />
I rode as I might, and came<br />
To my love at close of day.<br />
<br />
The sight of her stilled my fears,<br />
My fairest-hearted love:<br />
And yet in her eyes were tears:<br />
Which when I questioned of,<br />

O now thou art come, she cried,<br />
'Tis fled: but I thought to-day<br />
I never could here abide,<br />

The storm is over, the land hushes to rest:<br />
The tyrannous wind, its strength fordone,<br />
Is fallen back in the west<br />
To couch with the sinking sun.<br />
The last clouds fare<br />
With fainting speed, and their thin streamers fly<br />
In melting drifts of the sky.<br />
Already the birds in the air<a name="page_295" id="page_295"></a><span class="pagenumb">{295}</span><br />
Appear again; the rooks return to their haunt,<br />
And one by one,<br />
Proclaiming aloud their care,<br />
Renew their peaceful chant.<br />
<br />
Torn and shattered the trees their branches again reset,<br />
They trim afresh the fair<br />
Few green and golden leaves withheld from the storm,<br />
And awhile will be handsome yet.<br />
To-morrow's sun shall caress<br />
Their remnant of loveliness:<br />
In quiet days for a time<br />
Sad Autumn lingering warm<br />
Shall humour their faded prime.<br />
<br />
But ah! the leaves of summer that lie on the ground!<br />
What havoc! The laughing timbrels of June,<br />
That curtained the birds' cradles, and screened their song,<br />
That sheltered the cooing doves at noon,<br />
Of airy fans the delicate throng,&mdash;<br />
Torn and scattered around:<br />
Far out afield they lie,<br />
In the watery furrows die,<br />
In grassy pools of the flood they sink and drown,<br />
Green-golden, orange, vermilion, golden and brown,<br />
The high year's flaunting crown<br />
Shattered and trampled down.<br />
<br />
The day is done: the tired land looks for night:<br />
She prays to the night to keep<br />
In peace her nerves of delight:<br />
While silver mist upstealeth silently,<br />
And the broad cloud driving moon in the clear sky<br />
Lifts o'er the firs her shining shield,<br />
And in her tranquil light<br />
Sleep falls on forest and field.<br />
SÃ©e! slÃ©ep hath fallen: the trees are asleep:<br />
The night is come. The land is wrapt in sleep.<br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 5%">THE WINNOWERS</span><br />&nbsp; <br />

Betwixt two billows of the downs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The little hamlet lies,</span><br />
And nothing sees but the bald crowns<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the hills, and the blue skies.</span><br />
<br />
Clustering beneath the long descent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And grey slopes of the wold,</span><br />
The red roofs nestle, oversprent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With lichen yellow as gold.</span><br />
<br />
We found it in the mid-day sun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Basking, what time of year</span><br />
The thrush his singing has begun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere the first leaves appear.</span><br />
<br />
High from his load a woodman pitched<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His faggots on the stack:</span><br />
Knee-deep in straw the cattle twitched<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet hay from crib and rack:</span><br />
<br />
And from the barn hard by was borne<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A steady muffled din,</span><br />
By which we knew that threshÃ¨d corn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was winnowing, and went in.<a name="page_302" id="page_302"></a><span class="pagenumb">{302}</span></span><br />

The sunbeams on the motey air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Streamed through the open door,</span><br />
And on the brown arms moving bare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the grain upon the floor.</span><br />
<br />
One turns the crank, one stoops to feed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hopper, lest it lack,</span><br />
One in the bushel scoops the seed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One stands to hold the sack.</span><br />
<br />
We watched the good grain rattle down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the awns fly in the draught;</span><br />
To see us both so pensive grown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The honest labourers laughed:</span><br />
<br />
Merry they were, because the wheat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was clean and plump and good,</span><br />
Pleasant to hand and eye, and meet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For market and for food.</span><br />
<br />
It chanced we from the city were,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And had not gat us free</span><br />
In spirit from the store and stir<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of its immensity:</span><br />
<br />
But here we found ourselves again.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where humble harvests bring</span><br />
After much toil but little grain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis merry winnowing.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />

And in the feathery aster bees on wing<br />
Seize and set free the honied flowers,<br />
Till thousand stars leap with their visiting:<br />
While ever across the path mazily flit,<br />
Unpiloted in the sun,<br />
The dreamy butterflies<br />
With dazzling colours powdered and soft glooms,<br />
White, black and crimson stripes, and peacock eyes,<br />
Or on chance flowers sit,<br />
With idle effort plundering one by one<br />
The nectaries of deepest-throated blooms.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With gentle flaws the western breeze</span><br />
Into the garden saileth,<br />
Scarce here and there stirring the single trees,<br />

So long a comrade of the bearded corn,<br />

O'er dewy lawns he turns to stray,<br />
As mindful of the kisses and soft play<br />
Wherewith he enamoured the light-hearted May,<br />

Nor spicy pink,<a name="page_305" id="page_305"></a><span class="pagenumb">{305}</span><br />

Of courtly purple, and aromatic phlox.<br />

Of dizzy flies, and humming drones,<br />
With sudden flap of pigeon wings in the sky,<br />
Or the wild cry<br />
Of thirsty rooks, that scour ascare<br />
The distant blue, to watering as they fare<br />
With creaking pinions, or&mdash;on business bent,<br />
If aught their ancient polity displease,&mdash;<br />
Come gathering to their colony, and there<br />
Settling in ragged parliament,<br />

That love will change in growing old;<br />
Though day by day is nought to see,<br />

And in the end 'twill come to pass<br />
Quite to forget what once he was,<br />

Cold is the winter day, misty and dark:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sunless sky with faded gleams is rent:</span><br />
And patches of thin snow outlying, mark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The landscape with a drear disfigurement.</span><br />
<br />
The trees their mournful branches lift aloft:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The oak with knotty twigs is full of trust,</span><br />
With bud-thronged bough the cherry in the croft;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The chestnut holds her gluey knops upthrust.</span><br />
<br />
No birds sing, but the starling chaps his bill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And chatters mockingly; the newborn lambs</span><br />
Within their strawbuilt fold beneath the hill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Answer with plaintive cry their bleating dams.</span><br />
<br />
Their voices melt in welcome dreams of spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Green grass and leafy trees and sunny skies:</span><br />
My fancy decks the woods, the thrushes sing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meadows are gay, bees hum and scents arise.</span><br />
<br />
And God the Maker doth my heart grow bold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To praise for wintry works not understood,</span><br />
Who all the worlds and ages doth behold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Evil and good as one, and all as good.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />

The bushes where I nested are all cut down,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And my mate is dead and gone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the winter she died and left me lone.</span><br />
<br />
She lay in the thicket where I fear to go;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For when the March-winds after the snow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The leaves away did blow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She was not there, and my heart is woe:</span><br />
<br />
And sad is my song, when I begin to sing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I sit in the sunshine this merry spring:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Like a withered leaf I cling</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the white oak-bough, while the wood doth ring.</span><br />

Spring is coming now, the sun again is gay;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each day like a last spring's happy day.'&mdash;</span><br />

I never shall love the snow again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Since Maurice died:</span><br />
With corniced drift it blocked the lane<br />
And sheeted in a desolate plain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The country side.<a name="page_310" id="page_310"></a><span class="pagenumb">{310}</span></span><br />
<br />
The trees with silvery rime bedight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Their branches bare.</span><br />
By day no sun appeared; by night<br />
The hidden moon shed thievish light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In the misty air.</span><br />
<br />
We fed the birds that flew around<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In flocks to be fed:</span><br />
No shelter in holly or brake they found.<br />
The speckled thrush on the frozen ground<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Lay frozen and dead.</span><br />
<br />
We skated on stream and pond; we cut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The crinching snow</span><br />
To Doric temple or Arctic hut;<br />
We laughed and sang at nightfall, shut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">By the fireside glow.</span><br />
<br />
Yet grudged we our keen delights before<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Maurice should come.</span><br />
We said, In-door or out-of-door<br />
We shall love life for a month or more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When he is home.</span><br />
<br />
They brought him home; 'twas two days late<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For Christmas day:</span><br />
Wrapped in white, in solemn state,<br />
A flower in his hand, all still and straight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Our Maurice lay.</span><br />
<br />
And two days ere the year outgave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">We laid him low.</span><br />
The best of us truly were not brave,<br />
When we laid Maurice down in his grave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Under the snow.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A melody, that arose</span><br />

Of all fair sounds that I love, remembered together<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In one; and I knew not whether</span><br />
From waves of rustling wheat it was,<br />

FOUNDER'S DAY. A SECULAR ODE<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ON THE NINTH JUBILEE OF<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ETON COLLEGE&nbsp;<br />

Christ and his Mother, heavenly maid,<br />
Mary, in whose fair name was laid<br />
Eton's corner, bless our youth<br />
With truth, and purity, mother of truth!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O ye, 'neath breezy skies of June,</span><br />
By silver Thames's lulling tune,<br />
In shade of willow or oak, who try<br />
The golden gates of poesy;<br />
<br />
Or on the tabled sward all day<br />
Match your strength in England's play,<br />
Scholars of Henry, giving grace<br />
To toil and force in game or race;<br />
<br />
Exceed the prayer and keep the fame<br />
Of him, the sorrowful king, who came<br />
Here in his realm a realm to found,<br />
Where he might stand for ever crowned.<br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or whether with naked bodies flashing</span><br />
Ye plunge in the lashing weir; or dashing<br />
The oars of cedar skiffs, ye strain<br />
Round the rushes and home again;&mdash;<br />
<br />
Or what pursuit soe'er it be<br />
That makes your mingled presence free,<br />
When by the schoolgate 'neath the limes<br />
Ye muster waiting the lazy chimes;<a name="page_314" id="page_314"></a><span class="pagenumb">{314}</span><br />
May Peace, that conquereth sin and death,<br />
Temper for you her sword of faith;<br />
Crown with honour the loving eyes,<br />
And touch with mirth the mouth of the wise.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here is eternal spring: for you</span><br />
The very stars of heaven are new;<br />
And aged Fame again is born,<br />
Fresh as a peeping flower of morn.<br />
<br />
For you shall Shakespeare's scene unroll,<br />
Mozart shall steal your ravished soul,<br />
Homer his bardic hymn rehearse,<br />
Virgil recite his maiden verse.<br />
<br />
Now learn, love, have, do, be the best;<br />
Each in one thing excel the rest:<br />
Strive; and hold fast this truth of heaven&mdash;<br />
To him that hath shall more be given.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Slow on your dial the shadows creep,</span><br />
So many hours for food and sleep,<br />
So many hours till study tire,<br />
So many hours for heart's desire.<br />
<br />
These suns and moons shall memory save,<br />
Mirrors bright for her magic cave;<br />
Wherein may steadfast eyes behold<br />
A self that groweth never old.<br />
<br />
O in such prime enjoy your lot,<br />
And when ye leave regret it not;<br />
With wishing gifts in festal state<br />
Pass ye the angel-sworded gate.<a name="page_315" id="page_315"></a><span class="pagenumb">{315}</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then to the world let shine your light,</span><br />
Children in play be lions in fight,<br />
And match with red immortal deeds<br />
The victory that made ring the meads:<br />
<br />
Or by firm wisdom save your land<br />
From giddy head and grasping hand:<br />
<span class="smcap">Improve the best</span>; so shall your sons<br />
Better what ye have bettered once.<br />
<br />
Send them here to the court of grace<br />
Bearing your name to fill your place:<br />
Ye in their time shall live again<br />
The happy dream of Henry's reign:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And on his day your steps be bent</span><br />
Where, saint and king, crowned with content,<br />
He biddeth a prayer to bless his youth<br />
With truth, and purity, mother of truth.<br />&nbsp;<br />

The north wind came up yesternight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the new year's full moon,</span><br />
And rising as she gained her height,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grew to a tempest soon.</span><br />
Yet found he not on heaven's face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A task of cloud to clear;</span><br />
There was no speck that he might chase<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Off the blue hemisphere,</span><br />
Nor vapour from the land to drive:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The frost-bound country held</span><br />
Nought motionable or alive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That 'gainst his wrath rebelled.</span><br />
There scarce was hanging in the wood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A shrivelled leaf to reave;<a name="page_316" id="page_316"></a><span class="pagenumb">{316}</span></span><br />
No bud had burst its swathing hood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he could rend or grieve:</span><br />
Only the tall tree-skeletons,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where they were shadowed all,</span><br />
Wavered a little on the stones,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on the white church-wall.</span><br />
<br />
&mdash;Like as an artist in his mood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who reckons all as nought,</span><br />
So he may quickly paint his nude,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unutterable thought:</span><br />
So Nature in a frenzied hour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By day or night will show</span><br />
Dim indications of the power<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That doometh man to woe.</span><br />
Ah, many have my visions been,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some I know full well:</span><br />
I would that all that I have seen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were fit for speech to tell.&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
And by the churchyard as I came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It seemed my spirit passed</span><br />
Into a land that hath no name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grey, melancholy and vast;</span><br />
Where nothing comes: but Memory,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The widowed queen of Death,</span><br />
Reigns, and with fixed, sepulchral eye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All slumber banisheth.</span><br />
Each grain of writhen dust, that drapes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sickly, staring shore,</span><br />
Its old chaotic change of shapes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remembers evermore.</span><br />
And ghosts of cities long decayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ruined shrines of Fate</span><br />
Gather the paths, that Time hath made<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Foolish and desolate.<a name="page_317" id="page_317"></a><span class="pagenumb">{317}</span></span><br />

Nor winter there hath hope of spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor the pale night of day,</span><br />
Since the old king with scorpion sting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath done himself away.</span><br />
<br />
The morn was calm; the wind's last breath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had fal'n: in solemn hush</span><br />
The golden moon went down beneath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dawning's crimson flush.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />

In a hurricane through the trees he teareth,<br />
Raking the boughs and the leaves rending,<br />

Gold and snow he mixeth in spite,<br />

He passeth, and all again for awhile is bright.<br />&nbsp;<br />

<h2>NEW POEMS</h2>

<p class="head">ECLOGUE I<br />&nbsp;<br />
THE MONTHS</p>

<p class="poem10">
<span style="margin-left: 11%"><i>BASIL AND EDWARD</i></span><br />&nbsp; <br />

Man hath with man on earth no holier bond<br />
Than that the Muse weaves with her dreamy thread:<br />
Nor e'er was such transcendent love more fond<br />
Than that which Edward unto Basil led,<br />
Wandering alone across the woody shires<br />
To hear the living voice of that wide heart,<br />
To see the eyes that read the world's desires,<br />
And touch the hand that wrote the roving rhyme.<br />
Diverse their lots as distant were their homes,<br />
And since that early meeting, jealous Time<br />
Knitting their loves had held their lives apart.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now again were these fine lovers met</span><br />
And sat together on a rocky hill<br />
Looking upon the vales of Somerset,<br />
Where the far sea gleam'd o'er the bosky combes,<br />
Satisfying their spirits the livelong day<br />
With various mirth and revelation due<br />
And delicate intimacy of delight,<br />
As there in happy indolence they lay<br />
And drank the sun, while round the breezy height<br />
Beneath their feet rabbit and listless ewe<br />
Nibbled the scented herb and grass at will.<a name="page_324" id="page_324"></a><span class="pagenumb">{324}</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Much talked they at their ease; and at the last</span><br />
Spoke Edward thus, ''Twas on this very hill<br />
This time of the year,&mdash;but now twelve years are past,&mdash;<br />
That you provoked in verse my younger skill<br />
To praise the months against your rival song;<br />
And ere the sun had westered ten degrees<br />
Our rhyme had brought him thro' the Zodiac.<br />
Have you remembered?'&mdash;Basil answer'd back,<br />
'Guest of my solace, how could I forget?<br />
Years fly as months that seem'd in youth so long.<br />
The precious life that, like indifferent gold,<br />
Is disregarded in its worth to hold<br />
Some jewel of love that God therein would set,<br />
It passeth and is gone.'&mdash;'And yet not all,'<br />
Edward replied: 'The passion as I please<br />
Of that past day I can to-day recall;<br />
And if but you, as I, remember yet<br />
Your part thereof, and will again rehearse,<br />
For half an hour we may old Time outwit.'<br />
And Basil said, 'Alas for my poor verse!<br />
What happy memory of it still endures<br />
Will thank your love: I have forgotten it.<br />
Speak you my stanzas, I will ransom yours.<br />
Begin you then as I that day began,<br />
And I will follow as your answers ran.'<br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>JANUARY</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ed.</span> The moon that mounts the sun's deserted way,<br />
Turns the long winter night to a silver day;<br />
But setteth golden in face of the solemn sight<br />
Of her lord arising upon a world of white.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>FEBRUARY</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ba.</span> I have in my heart a vision of spring begun<br />
In a sheltering wood, that feels the kiss of the sun:<br />
And a thrush adoreth the melting day that dies<br />
In clouds of purple afloat upon saffron skies.<br />&nbsp;<br />

<a name="page_325" id="page_325"></a><span class="pagenumb">{325}</span>

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>MARCH</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ed.</span> Now carol the birds at dawn, and some new lay<br />
Announceth a homecome voyager every day.<br />
Beneath the tufted sallows the streamlet thrills<br />
With the leaping trout and the gleam of the daffodils.<br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>APRIL</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ba.</span> Then laugheth the year; with flowers the meads are bright;<br />
The bursting branches are tipped with flames of light:<br />
The landscape is light; the dark clouds flee above,<br />
And the shades of the land are a blue that is deep as love.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>MAY</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ed.</span> But if you have seen a village all red and old<br />
In cherry-orchards a-sprinkle with white and gold,<br />
By a hawthorn seated, or a witch-elm flowering high,<br />
A gay breeze making riot in the waving rye!<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>JUNE</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ba.</span> Then night retires from heaven; the high winds go<br />
A-sailing in cloud-pavilions of cavern'd snow.<br />
O June, sweet Philomel sang thy cradle-lay;<br />
In rosy revel thy spirit shall pass away.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>JULY</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ed.</span> Heavy is the green of the fields, heavy the trees<br />
With foliage hang, drowsy the hum of bees<br />
In the thund'rous air: the crowded scents lie low:<br />
Thro' tangle of weeds the river runneth slow.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>AUGUST</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ba.</span> A reaper with dusty shoon and hat of straw<br />
On the yellow field, his scythe in his armÃ«s braw:<br />
Beneath the tall grey trees resting at noon<br />
From sweat and swink with scythe and dusty shoon.<br />
<a name="page_326" id="page_326"></a><span class="pagenumb">{326}</span>&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>SEPTEMBER</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ed.</span> Earth's flaunting flower of passion fadeth fair<br />
To ripening fruit in sunlit veils of the air,<br />
As the art of man makes wisdom to glorify<br />
The beauty and love of life born else to die.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>OCTOBER</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ba.</span> On frosty morns with the woods aflame, down, down<br />
The golden spoils fall thick from the chestnut crown.<br />
May Autumn in tranquil glory her riches spend,<br />
With mellow apples her orchard-branches bend.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>NOVEMBER</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ed.</span> Sad mists have hid the sun, the land is forlorn:<br />
The plough is afield, the hunter windeth his horn.<br />
Dame Prudence looketh well to her winter stores,<br />
And many a wise man finds his pleasure indoors.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>DECEMBER</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span class="smcap">Ba.</span> I pray thee don thy jerkin of olden time,<br />
Bring us good ice, and silver the trees with rime;<br />
And I will good cheer, good music and wine bestow,<br />
When the Christmas guest comes galloping over the snow.<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
Thus they in verse alternate sang the year<br />
For rabbit shy and listless ewe to hear,<br />
Among the grey rocks on the mountain green<br />
Beneath the sky in fair and pastoral scene,<br />
Like those Sicilian swains, whose doric tongue<br />
After two thousand years is ever young,&mdash;<br />
<i>Sweet the pine's murmur, and, shepherd, sweet thy pipe,&mdash;</i><br />
Or that which gentle Virgil, yet unripe,<br />
Of Tityrus sang under the spreading beech<br />
And gave to rustic clowns immortal speech,<br />
By rocky fountain or on flowery mead<a name="page_327" id="page_327"></a><span class="pagenumb">{327}</span><br />
Bidding their idle flocks at will to feed,<br />
While they, retreated to some bosky glade,<br />
Together told their loves, and as they played<br />
Sang what sweet thing soe'er the poet feigned:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But these were men when good Victoria reigned,</span><br />
Poets themselves, who without shepherd gear<br />
Each of his native fancy sang the year.<br />

GIOVANNI DUPRÃˆ</p>

<p class="poem15"><span style="margin-left: 8%;"><i>LAWRENCE AND RICHARD</i></span>&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>LAWRENCE</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Look down the river&mdash;against the western sky&mdash;<br />
The Ponte Santa TrinitÃ &mdash;what throng<br />
Slowly trails o'er with waving banners high,<br />
With foot and horse! Surely they bear along<br />
The spoil of one whom Florence honoureth:<br />
And hark! the drum, the trumpeting dismay,<br />
The wail of the triumphal march of death.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

'Twill be the funeral of GiovÃ¡nn DuprÃ¨<br />
Wending to Santa Croce. Let us go<br />
And see what relic of old splendour cheers<br />
The dying ritual.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>LAWRENCE</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 8em;">They esteem him well</span><br />
To lay his bones with Michael Angelo.<br />
Who might he be?<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 8em;">He too a sculptor, one</span><br />
Who left a work long to resist the years.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>LAWRENCE</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

You make me question further.<br />

<a name="page_328" id="page_328"></a><span class="pagenumb">{328}</span>

&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I can tell</span><br />
All as we walk. A poor woodcarver's son,<br />
Prenticed to cut his father's rude designs<br />
(We have it from himself), maker of shrines,<br />
In his mean workshop in Siena dreamed;<br />
And saw as gods the artists of the earth,<br />
And long'd to stand on their immortal shore,<br />
And be as they, who in his vision gleam'd,<br />
Dowering the world with grace for evermore.<br />
So, taxing rest and leisure to one aim,<br />
The boy of single will and inbred skill<br />
Rose step by step to academic fame.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>LAWRENCE</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Do I not know him then? His figures fill<br />
The tympana o'er Santa Croce's gate;<br />
In the museum too, his Cain, that stands<br />
A left-handed discobolos....<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 18em;">So great</span><br />
His vogue, that elder art of classic worth<br />
Went to the wall to give his statues room;<br />
And last&mdash;his country's praise could do no more&mdash;<br />
He cut the stone that honoured good Cavour.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>LAWRENCE</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

I have seen the things.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">He, finding in his hands</span><br />
His life-desire possest, fell not in gloom,<br />
Nor froth'd in vanity: his Sabbath earn'd<br />
He look'd to spend in meditative rest:<br />
So laying chisel by, he took a pen<br />
To tell his story to his countrymen,<br />
And prove (he did it) that the flower of all,<br />
Rarest to attain, is in the power of all.<br />

<a name="page_329" id="page_329"></a><span class="pagenumb">{329}</span>
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>LAWRENCE</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Yet nought he ever made, that I have learn'd,<br />
In wood or stone deserved, nay not his best,<br />
The Greek or Tuscan name for beautiful.<br />
'Twas level with its praise, had force to pull<br />
Favour from fashion.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Yet he made one thing</span><br />
Worthy of the lily city in her spring;<br />
For while in vain the forms of beauty he aped,<br />
A perfect spirit in himself he shaped;<br />
And all his lifetime doing less than well<br />
Where he profess'd nor doubted to excel,<br />
Now, where he had no scholarship, but drew<br />
His art from love, 'twas better than he knew:<br />
And when he sat to write, lo! by him stood<br />
The heavenly Muse, who smiles on all things good;<br />
And for his truth's sake, for his stainless mind,<br />
His homely love and faith, she now grew kind,<br />
And changed the crown, that from the folk he got,<br />
For her green laurel, and he knew it not.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>LAWRENCE</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Ah! Love of Beauty! This man then mistook<br />
Ambition for her?<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 9em;">In simplicity</span><br />
Erring he kept his truth; and in his book<br />
The statue of his grace is fair to see.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>LAWRENCE</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Then buried with their great he well may be.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

And number'd with the saints, not among them<br />
Who painted saints. Join we his requiem.<br />

FOURTH OF JUNE AT ETON</p>

<p class="poem15">
<span style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>RICHARD AND GODFREY</i></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Beneath the wattled bank the eddies swarm<br />
In wandering dimples o'er the shady pool:<br />
The same their chase as when I was at school;<br />
The same the music, where in shallows warm<br />
The current, sunder'd by the bushy isles,<br />
Returns to join the main, and struggles free<br />
Above the willows, gurgling thro' the piles:<br />
Nothing is changed, and yet how changed are we!<br />
&mdash;What can bring Godfrey to the Muses' bower?<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>GODFREY</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

What but brings you? The festal day of the year;<br />
To live in boyish memories for an hour;<br />
See and be seen: tho' you come seldom here.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Dread of the pang it was, fear to behold<br />
What once was all myself, that kept me away.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>GODFREY</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

You miss new pleasures coveting the old.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

They need have prudence, who in courage lack;<br />
'Twas that I might go on I looked not back.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>GODFREY</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Of all our company he, who, we say,<br />
Fruited the laughing flower of liberty!<br />

<a name="page_331" id="page_331"></a><span class="pagenumb">{331}</span>

&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Ah! had I my desire, so should it be.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>GODFREY</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Nay, but I know this melancholy mood;<br />
'Twas your poetic fancy when a boy.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

For Fancy cannot live on real food:<br />
In youth she will despise familiar joy<br />
To dwell in mournful shades; as they grow real,<br />
Then buildeth she of joy her far ideal.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>GODFREY</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

And so perverteth all. This stream to me<br />
Sings, and in sunny ripples lingeringly<br />
The water saith 'Ah me! where have I lept?<br />
Into what garden of life? what banks are these,<br />
What secret lawns, what ancient towers and trees?<br />
Where the young sons of heav'n, with shouts of play<br />
Or low delighted speech, welcome the day,<br />
As if the poetry of the earth had slept<br />
To wake in ecstasy. O stay me! alas!<br />
Stay me, ye happy isles, ere that I pass<br />
Without a memory on my sullen course<br />
By the black city to the tossing seas!'<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

So might this old oak say 'My heart is sere;<br />
With greater effort every year I force<br />
My stubborn leafage: soon my branch will crack,<br />
And I shall fall or perish in the wrack:<br />
And here another tree its crown will rear,<br />
And see for centuries the boys at play:<br />
And 'neath its boughs, on some fine holiday,<br />
Old men shall prate as these.' Come see the game.<br />

<a name="page_332" id="page_332"></a><span class="pagenumb">{332}</span>
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>GODFREY</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Yes, if you will. 'Tis all one picture fair.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

Made in a mirror, and who looketh there<br />
Must see himself. Is not a dream the same?<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>GODFREY</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<i>Life is a dream.</i><br />
&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>RICHARD</small></span>&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 12%">ELEGY</span><br />&nbsp; <br />

<span style="margin-left: 2%"><small>THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND</small></span><br />&nbsp; <br />

How well my eyes remember the dim path!<br />
My homing heart no happier playground hath.<br />
I need not close my lids but it appears<br />
Through the bewilderment of forty years<br />
To tempt my feet, my childish feet, between<br />
Its leafy walls, beneath its arching green;<br />
Fairer than dream of sleep, than Hope more fair<br />
Leading to dreamless sleep her sister Care.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There grew two fellow limes, two rising trees,</span><br />
Shadowing the lawn, the summer haunt of bees,<br />
Whose stems, engraved with many a russet scar<br />
From the spear-hurlings of our mimic war,<br />
Pillar'd the portico to that wide walk,<br />
A mossy terrace of the native chalk<br />
Fashion'd, that led thro' the dark shades around<br />
Straight to the wooden temple on the mound.<br />
There live the memories of my early days,<br />
There still with childish heart my spirit plays;<a name="page_333" id="page_333"></a><span class="pagenumb">{333}</span><br />
Yea, terror-stricken by the fiend despair<br />
When she hath fled me, I have found her there;<br />
And there 'tis ever noon, and glad suns bring<br />
Alternate days of summer and of spring,<br />
With childish thought, and childish faces bright,<br />
And all unknown save but the hour's delight.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">High on the mound the ivied arbour stood,</span><br />
A dome of straw upheld on rustic wood:<br />
Hidden in fern the steps of the ascent,<br />
Whereby unto the southern front we went,<br />
And from the dark plantation climbing free,<br />
Over a valley look'd out on the sea.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sea is ever bright and blue, the sky</span><br />
Serene and blue, and ever white ships lie<br />
High on the horizon steadfast in full sail,<br />
Or nearer in the roads pass within hail,<br />
Of naked brigs and barques that windbound ride<br />
At their taut cables heading to the tide.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There many an hour I have sat to watch; nay, now</span><br />
The brazen disk is cold against my brow,<br />
And in my sight a circle of the sea<br />
Enlarged to swiftness, where the salt waves flee,<br />
And ships in stately motion pass so near<br />
That what I see is speaking to my ear:<br />
I hear the waves dash and the tackle strain,<br />
The canvas flap, the rattle of the chain<br />
That runs out thro' the hawse, the clank of the winch<br />
Winding the rusty cable inch by inch,<br />
Till half I wonder if they have no care,<br />
Those sailors, that my glass is brought to bear<br />
On all their doings, if I vex them not<br />
On every petty task of their rough lot<br />
Prying and spying, searching every craft<br />
From painted truck to gunnel, fore and aft,&mdash;<a name="page_334" id="page_334"></a><span class="pagenumb">{334}</span><br />
Thro' idle Sundays as I have watch'd them lean<br />
Long hours upon the rail, or neath its screen<br />
Prone on the deck to lie outstretch'd at length,<br />
Sunk in renewal of their wearied strength.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But what a feast of joy to me, if some</span><br />
Fast-sailing frigate to the Channel come<br />
Back'd here her topsail, or brought gently up<br />
Let from her bow the splashing anchor drop,<br />
By faint contrary wind stay'd in her cruise,<br />
The <i>Phaethon</i> or dancing <i>Arethuse</i>,<br />
Or some immense three-decker of the line,<br />
Romantic as the tale of Troy divine;<br />
Ere yet our iron age had doom'd to fall<br />
The towering freeboard of the wooden wall,<br />
And for the engines of a mightier Mars<br />
Clipp'd their wide wings, and dock'd their soaring spars.<br />
The gale that in their tackle sang, the wave<br />
That neath their gilded galleries dasht so brave<br />
Lost then their merriment, nor look to play<br />
With the heavy-hearted monsters of to-day.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One noon in March upon that anchoring ground</span><br />
Came Napier's fleet unto the Baltic bound:<br />
Cloudless the sky and calm and blue the sea,<br />
As round Saint Margaret's cliff mysteriously,<br />
Those murderous queens walking in Sabbath sleep<br />
Glided in line upon the windless deep:<br />
For in those days was first seen low and black<br />
Beside the full-rigg'd mast the strange smoke-stack,<br />
And neath their stern revolv'd the twisted fan.<br />
Many I knew as soon as I might scan,<br />
The heavy <i>Royal George</i>, the <i>Acre</i> bright,<br />
The <i>Hogue</i> and <i>Ajax</i>, and could name aright<br />
Others that I remember now no more;<br />
But chief, her blue flag flying at the fore,<a name="page_335" id="page_335"></a><span class="pagenumb">{335}</span><br />
With fighting guns a hundred thirty and one,<br />
The Admiral ship <i>The Duke of Wellington</i>,<br />
Whereon sail'd George, who in her gig had flown<br />
The silken ensign by our sisters sewn.<br />
The iron Duke himself,&mdash;whose soldier fame<br />
To England's proudest ship had given her name,<br />
And whose white hairs in this my earliest scene<br />
Had scarce more honour'd than accustom'd been,&mdash;<br />
Was two years since to his last haven past:<br />
I had seen his castle-flag to fall half-mast<br />
One morn as I sat looking on the sea,<br />
When thus all England's grief came first to me,<br />
Who hold my childhood favour'd that I knew<br />
So well the face that won at Waterloo.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now 'tis other wars, and other men;&mdash;</span><br />
The year that Napier sail'd, my years were ten&mdash;<br />
Yea, and new homes and loves my heart hath found:<br />
A priest has there usurped the ivied mound,<br />
The bell that call'd to horse calls now to prayers,<br />
And silent nuns tread the familiar stairs.<br />
Within the peach-clad walls that old outlaw,<br />
The Roman wolf, scratches with privy paw.<br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The south wind rose at dusk of the winter day,</span><br />
The warm breath of the western sea<br />
Circling wrapp'd the isle with his cloke of cloud,<br />
And it now reach'd even to me, at dusk of the day,<br />
And moan'd in the branches aloud:<br />
While here and there, in patches of dark space,<br />
A star shone forth from its heavenly place,<br />
As a spark that is borne in the smoky chase;<br />
And, looking up, there fell on my face&mdash;<br />
Could it be drops of rain<br />
Soft as the wind, that fell on my face?<br />
Gossamers light as threads of the summer dawn,<a name="page_337" id="page_337"></a><span class="pagenumb">{337}</span><br />
Suck'd by the sun from midmost calms of the main,<br />
From groves of coral islands secretly drawn,<br />
O'er half the round of earth to be driven,<br />
Now to fall on my face<br />
In silky skeins spun from the mists of heaven.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who art thou, in wind and darkness and soft rain</span><br />
Thyself that robest, that bendest in sighing pines<br />
To whisper thy truth? that usest for signs<br />
A hurried glimpse of the moon, the glance of a star<br />
In the rifted sky?<br />
Who art thou, that with thee I<br />
Woo and am wooed?<br />
That robing thyself in darkness and soft rain<br />
Choosest my chosen solitude,<br />
Coming so far<br />
To tell thy secret again,<br />
As a mother her child, in her folding arm<br />
Of a winter night by a flickering fire,<br />
Telleth the same tale o'er and o'er<br />
With gentle voice, and I never tire,<br />
So imperceptibly changeth the charm,<br />
As Love on buried ecstasy buildeth his tower,<br />
&mdash;Like as the stem that beareth the flower<br />
By trembling is knit to power;&mdash;<br />
Ah! long ago<br />
In thy first rapture I renounced my lot,<br />
The vanity, the despondency and the woe,<br />
And seeking thee to know<br />
Well was 't for me, and evermore<br />
I am thine, I know not what.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For me thou seekest ever, me wondering a day</span><br />
In the eternal alternations, me<br />
Free for a stolen moment of chance<br />
To dream a beautiful dream<a name="page_338" id="page_338"></a><span class="pagenumb">{338}</span><br />
In the everlasting dance<br />
Of speechless worlds, the unsearchable scheme,<br />
To me thou findest the way,<br />
Me and whomsoe'er<br />
I have found my dream to share<br />
Still with thy charm encircling; even to-night<br />
To me and my love in darkness and soft rain<br />
Under the sighing pines thou comest again,<br />
And staying our speech with mystery of delight,<br />
Of the kiss that I give a wonder thou makest,<br />
And the kiss that I take thou takest.<br />&nbsp;<br />

The lonely season in lonely lands, when fled<br />
Are half the birds, and mists lie low, and the sun<br />
Is rarely seen, nor strayeth far from his bed;<br />
The short days pass unwelcomed one by one.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out by the ricks the mantled engine stands</span><br />
Crestfallen, deserted,&mdash;for now all hands<br />
Are told to the plough,&mdash;and ere it is dawn appear<br />
The teams following and crossing far and near,<br />
As hour by hour they broaden the brown bands<br />
Of the striped fields; and behind them firk and prance<br />
The heavy rooks, and daws grey-pated dance:<br />
As awhile, surmounting a crest, in sharp outline<br />
(A miniature of toil, a gem's design,)<br />
They are pictured, horses and men, or now near by<br />
Above the lane they shout lifting the share,<br />
By the trim hedgerow bloom'd with purple air;<br />
Where, under the thorns, dead leaves in huddle lie<br />
Packed by the gales of Autumn, and in and out<br />
The small wrens glide<br />
With a happy note of cheer,<br />
And yellow amorets flutter above and about,<br />

From thistle-pastures hurrying to gain the shelter<br />
Of American rhododendron or cherry-laurel:<br />
And here and there, near chilly setting of sun,<br />
In an isolated tree a congregation<br />
Of starlings chatter and chide,<br />
Thickset as summer leaves, in garrulous quarrel:<br />
Suddenly they hush as one,&mdash;<br />
The tree top springs,&mdash;<br />
And off, with a whirr of wings,<br />
They fly by the score<br />
To the holly-thicket, and there with myriads more<br />
Dispute for the roosts; and from the unseen nation<br />
A babel of tongues, like running water unceasing,<br />
Makes live the wood, the flocking cries increasing,<br />
Wrangling discordantly, incessantly,<br />
While falls the night on them self-occupied;<br />
The long dark night, that lengthens slow,<br />
Deepening with Winter to starve grass and tree,<br />
And soon to bury in snow<br />
The Earth, that, sleeping 'neath her frozen stole,<br />
Shall dream a dream crept from the sunless pole<br />

A cottage built of native stone<br />
Stands on the mountain-moor alone,<br />
High from man's dwelling on the wide<br />
And solitary mountain-side,<br />
<br />
The purple mountain-side, where all<br />
The dewy night the meteors fall,<br />
And the pale stars musically set<br />
To the watery bells of the rivulet,<br />
<br />
And all day long, purple and dun,<br />
The vast moors stretch beneath the sun,<br />
The wide wind passeth fresh and hale,<br />
And whirring grouse and blackcock sail.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, heavenly Peace, where dost thou dwell?</span><br />
Surely 'twas here thou hadst a cell,<br />
Till flaming Love, wandering astray<br />
With fury and blood, drove thee away.&mdash;<br />
<br />
Far down across the valley deep<br />
The town is hid in smoky sleep,<br />
At moonless nightfall wakening slow<br />
Upon the dark with lurid glow:<br />
<br />
Beyond, afar the widening view<br />
Merges into the soften'd blue,<br />
Cornfield and forest, hill and stream,<br />
Fair England in her pastoral dream.<a name="page_355" id="page_355"></a><span class="pagenumb">{355}</span><br />
<br />
To one who looketh from this hill<br />
Life seems asleep, all is so still:<br />
Nought passeth save the travelling shade<br />
Of clouds on high that float and fade:<br />
<br />
Nor since this landscape saw the sun<br />
Might other motion o'er it run,<br />
Till to man's scheming heart it came<br />
To make a steed of steel and flame.<br />
<br />
Him may you mark in every vale<br />
Moving beneath his fleecy trail,<br />
And tell whene'er the motions die<br />
Where every town and hamlet lie.<br />
<br />
He gives the distance life to-day,<br />
Rushing upon his level'd way<br />
From man's abode to man's abode,<br />
And mocks the Roman's vaunted road,<br />
<br />
Which o'er the moor purple and dun<br />
Still wanders white beneath the sun,<br />
Deserted now of men and lone<br />
Save for this cot of native stone.<br />
<br />
There ever by the whiten'd wall<br />
Standeth a maiden fair and tall,<br />
And all day long in vacant dream<br />
Watcheth afar the flying steam.<br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 3%">SCREAMING TARN</span><br />&nbsp; <br />

The saddest place that e'er I saw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is the deep tarn above the inn</span><br />
That crowns the mountain-road, whereby<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One southward bound his way must win.<a name="page_356" id="page_356"></a><span class="pagenumb">{356}</span></span><br />
<br />
Sunk on the table of the ridge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From its deep shores is nought to see:</span><br />
The unresting wind lashes and chills<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its shivering ripples ceaselessly.</span><br />
<br />
Three sides 'tis banked with stones aslant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And down the fourth the rushes grow,</span><br />
And yellow sedge fringing the edge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With lengthen'd image all arow.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis square and black, and on its face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When noon is still, the mirror'd sky</span><br />
Looks dark and further from the earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than when you gaze at it on high.</span><br />
<br />
At mid of night, if one be there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;So say the people of the hill&mdash;</span><br />
A fearful shriek of death is heard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One sudden scream both loud and shrill.</span><br />
<br />
And some have seen on stilly nights,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when the moon was clear and round,</span><br />
Bubbles which to the surface swam<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And burst as if they held the sound.&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
'Twas in the days ere hapless Charles<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Losing his crown had lost his head,</span><br />
This tale is told of him who kept<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The inn upon the watershed:</span><br />
<br />
He was a lowbred ruin'd man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom lawless times set free from fear:</span><br />
One evening to his house there rode<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A young and gentle cavalier.</span><br />
<br />
With curling hair and linen fair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And jewel-hilted sword he went;</span><br />
The horse he rode he had ridden far,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he was with his journey spent.<a name="page_357" id="page_357"></a><span class="pagenumb">{357}</span></span><br />
<br />
He asked a lodging for the night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His valise from his steed unbound,</span><br />
He let none bear it but himself<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And set it by him on the ground.</span><br />
<br />
'Here's gold or jewels,' thought the host,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'That's carrying south to find the king.'</span><br />
He chattered many a loyal word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scraps of royal airs gan sing.</span><br />
<br />
His guest thereat grew more at ease<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And o'er his wine he gave a toast,</span><br />
But little ate, and to his room<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Carried his sack behind the host.</span><br />
<br />
'Now rest you well,' the host he said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But of his wish the word fell wide;</span><br />
Nor did he now forget his son<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who fell in fight by Cromwell's side.</span><br />
<br />
Revenge and poverty have brought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full gentler heart than his to crime;</span><br />
And he was one by nature rude,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Born to foul deeds at any time.</span><br />
<br />
With unshod feet at dead of night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In stealth he to the guest-room crept,</span><br />
Lantern and dagger in his hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And stabbed his victim while he slept.</span><br />
<br />
But as he struck a scream there came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fearful scream so loud and shrill:</span><br />
He whelm'd the face with pillows o'er,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lean'd till all had long been still.</span><br />
<br />
Then to the face the flame he held<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see there should no life remain:&mdash;</span><br />
When lo! his brutal heart was quell'd:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas a fair woman he had slain.<a name="page_358" id="page_358"></a><span class="pagenumb">{358}</span></span><br />
<br />
The tan upon her face was paint,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The manly hair was torn away,</span><br />
Soft was the breast that he had pierced;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beautiful in her death she lay.</span><br />
<br />
His was no heart to faint at crime,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tho' half he wished the deed undone.</span><br />
He pulled the valise from the bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To find what booty he had won.</span><br />
<br />
He cut the straps, and pushed within<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His murderous fingers to their theft.</span><br />
A deathly sweat came o'er his brow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He had no sense nor meaning left.</span><br />
<br />
He touched not gold, it was not cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was not hard, it felt like flesh.</span><br />
He drew out by the curling hair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A young man's head, and murder'd fresh;</span><br />
<br />
A young man's head, cut by the neck.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But what was dreader still to see,</span><br />
Her whom he had slain he saw again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The twain were like as like can be.</span><br />
<br />
Brother and sister if they were,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Both in one shroud they now were wound,&mdash;</span><br />
Across his back and down the stair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of the house without a sound.</span><br />
<br />
He made his way unto the tarn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The night was dark and still and dank;</span><br />
The ripple chuckling neath the boat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laughed as he drew it to the bank.</span><br />
<br />
Upon the bottom of the boat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He laid his burden flat and low,</span><br />
And on them laid the square sandstones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That round about the margin go.<a name="page_359" id="page_359"></a><span class="pagenumb">{359}</span></span><br />
<br />
Stone upon stone he weighed them down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until the boat would hold no more;</span><br />
The freeboard now was scarce an inch:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He stripp'd his clothes and push'd from shore.</span><br />
<br />
All naked to the middle pool<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He swam behind in the dark night;</span><br />
And there he let the water in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sank his terror out of sight.</span><br />
<br />
He swam ashore, and donn'd his dress,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scraped his bloody fingers clean;</span><br />
Ran home and on his victim's steed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mounted, and never more was seen.</span><br />
<br />
But to a comrade ere he died<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He told his story guess'd of none:</span><br />
So from his lips the crime returned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To haunt the spot where it was done.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 20%;">Eur. And. 1250.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Voyaging northwards by the western strand</span><br />
Of the Euxine sea we came to where the land<br />
Sinks low in salt morass and wooded plain:<br />
Here mighty Ister pushes to the main,<br />
Forking his turbid flood in channels three<br />
To plough the sands wherewith he chokes the sea.<a name="page_360" id="page_360"></a><span class="pagenumb">{360}</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against his middle arm, not many a mile</span><br />
In the offing of black water is the isle<br />
Named of Achilles, or as LeukÃª known,<br />
Which tender Thetis, counselling alone<br />
With her wise sire beneath the ocean-wave<br />
Unto her child's departed spirit gave,<br />
Where he might still his love and fame enjoy,<br />
Through the vain Danaan cause fordone at Troy.<br />
Thither Achilles passed, and long fulfill'd<br />
His earthly lot, as the high gods had will'd,<br />
Far from the rivalries of men, from strife,<br />
From arms, from woman's love and toil of life.<br />
Now of his lone abode I will unfold<br />
What there I saw, or was by others told.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is in truth a temple on the isle;</span><br />
Therein a wooden statue of rude style<br />
And workmanship antique with helm of lead:<br />
Else all is desert, uninhabited;<br />
Only a few goats browse the wind-swept rocks,<br />
And oft the stragglers of their starving flocks<br />
Are caught and sacrificed by whomsoe'er,<br />
Whoever of chance or purpose hither fare:<br />
About the fence lie strewn their bleaching bones.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But in the temple jewels and precious stones,</span><br />
Upheapt with golden rings and vials lie,<br />
Thankofferings to Achilles, and thereby,<br />
Written or scratch'd upon the walls in view,<br />
Inscriptions, with the givers' names thereto,<br />
Some in Romaic character, some Greek,<br />
As each man in the tongue that he might speak<br />
Wrote verse of praise, or prayer for good to come,<br />
To Achilles most, but to Patroclus some;<br />
For those who strongly would Achilles move<br />
Approach him by the pathway of his love.<a name="page_361" id="page_361"></a><span class="pagenumb">{361}</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thousands of birds frequent the sheltering shrine,</span><br />
The dippers and the swimmers of the brine,<br />
Sea-mew and gull and diving cormorant,<br />
Fishers that on the high cliff make their haunt<br />
Sheer inaccessible, and sun themselves<br />
Huddled arow upon the narrow shelves:&mdash;<br />
And surely no like wonder e'er hath been<br />
As that such birds should keep the temple clean;<br />
But thus they do: at earliest dawn of day<br />
They flock to sea and in the waters play,<br />
And when they well have wet their plumage light,<br />
Back to the sanctuary they take flight<br />
Splashing the walls and columns with fresh brine,<br />
Till all the stone doth fairly drip and shine,<br />
When off again they skim asea for more<br />
And soon returning sprinkle steps and floor,<br />
And sweep all cleanly with their wide-spread wings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From other men I have learnt further things.</span><br />
If any of free purpose, thus they tell,<br />
Sail'd hither to consult the oracle,&mdash;<br />
For oracle there was,&mdash;they sacrificed<br />
Such victims as they brought, if such sufficed,<br />
And some they slew, some to the god set free:<br />
But they who driven from their course at sea<br />
Chanced on the isle, took of the goats thereon<br />
And pray'd Achilles to accept his own.<br />
Then made they a gift, and when they had offer'd once,<br />
If to their question there was no response,<br />
They added to the gift and asked again;<br />
Yea twice and more, until the god should deign<br />
Answer to give, their offering they renew'd;<br />
Whereby great riches to the shrine ensued.<br />
And when both sacrifice and gifts were made<br />
They worship'd at the shrine, and as they pray'd<a name="page_362" id="page_362"></a><span class="pagenumb">{362}</span><br />
Sailors aver that often hath been seen<br />
A man like to a god, of warrior mien,<br />
A beauteous form of figure swift and strong;<br />
Down on his shoulders his light hair hung long<br />
And his full armour was enchast with gold:<br />
While some, who with their eyes might nought behold,<br />
Say that with music strange the air was stir'd;<br />
And some there are, who have both seen and heard:<br />
And if a man wish to be favour'd more,<br />
He need but spend one night upon the shore;<br />
To him in sleep Achilles will appear<br />
And lead him to his tent, and with good cheer<br />
Show him all friendliness that men desire;<br />
Patroclus pours the wine, and he his lyre<br />
Takes from the pole and plays the strains thereon<br />
Which Cheiron taught him first on Pelion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These things I tell as they were told to me,</span><br />
Nor do I question but it well may be:<br />
For sure I am that, if man ever was,<br />
Achilles was a hero, both because<br />
Of his high birth and beauty, his country's call,<br />
His valour of soul, his early death withal,<br />
For Homer's praise, the crown of human art;<br />
And that above all praise he had at heart<br />
A gentler passion in her sovran sway,<br />
And when his love died threw his life away.<br />&nbsp;<br />

Hark! The world is full of thy praise,<br />
England's Queen of many days;<br />
Who, knowing how to rule the free,<br />
Hast given a crown to monarchy.<br />

Honour, Truth and growing Peace<br />

And Nature yield her strength unknown<br />
To the wisdom born beneath thy throne!<br />

Enemies bow to revere thy name:<br />
The world shall never tire to tell<br />
Praise of the queen that reignÃ¨d well.<br />

<h2>LATER POEMS</h2>

<p class="poem15">
<span style="margin-left: 18%">1</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
<span style="margin-left: 2%">RECOLLECTIONS OF SOLITUDE</span><br />&nbsp; <br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%"><small>AN ELEGY</small></span><br />&nbsp; <br />

Ended are many days, and now but few<br />
Remain; since therefore it is happy and true<br />
That memoried joys keep ever their delight,<br />
Like steadfast stars in the blue vault of night,<br />
While hours of pain (among those heavenly spheres<br />
Like falling meteors, the martyr's tears)<br />
Dart their long trails at random, and anon,<br />
Ere we exclaim, pass, and for aye are gone;<br />
Therefore my heedy thought will oft restore<br />
The long light-hearted days that are no more,<br />
Save where in her memorial crypt they shine<br />
Spangling the silent past with joy divine.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But why in dream of this enchanted mood</span><br />
Should all my boyhood seem a solitude?<br />
Good reason know I, when I wander there,<br />
In that transmuted scene, why all is fair;<br />
The woods as when in holiday of spring<br />
Million buds burst, and flowers are blossoming;<br />
The meadows deep in grass, the fields unshorn<br />
In beauty of the multitudinous corn,<br />
Where the strait alleys hide me, wall'd between<br />
High bloomy stalks and rustling banners green;<br />
The gardens, too, in dazzling hues full-blown,<br />
With wafted scent and blazing petals strewn;<br />
The orchards reddening thro' the patient hours,<br />
While idle autumn in his mossy bowers<a name="page_368" id="page_368"></a><span class="pagenumb">{368}</span><br />
Inviteth meditation to endear<br />
The sanctuaries of the mellowing year;<br />
And every spot wherein I loved to stray<br />
Hath borrowed radiance of eternal day;<br />
But why am I ever alone, alone?<br />
Here in the corner of a field my throne,<br />
Now in the branching chair of some tall tree<br />
Drinking the gale in bird-like liberty;<br />
Or to the seashore wandered in the sun<br />
To watch the fateful waves break one by one;<br />
Or if on basking downs supine I lie<br />
Bathing my spirit in blue calms of the sky;<br />
Or to the river bank am stolen by night<br />
Hearkening unto the moonlit ripple bright<br />
That warbles o'er the shallows of smooth stone;<br />
Why should my memory find me all alone,<br />
When I had such companions every day<br />
Jocund and dear? 'Twixt glimpses of their play<br />
'Tis a vast solitude, wherein I see<br />
Only myself and what I came to be.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet never think, dear spirits, if now ye may</span><br />
Remember aught of that brief earthly day,<br />
Ere ye the mournful Stygian river crost,<br />
From our familiar home too early lost,&mdash;<br />
O never think that I your tears forget,<br />
Or that I loved not well, or love not yet.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor ye who held my heart in passion's chain,&mdash;</span><br />
As kings and queens succeed in glorious reign&mdash;<br />
When, as a man, I made you to outvie<br />
God's work, and, as a god, then set you by<br />
Among the sainted throng in holiest shrine<br />
Of mythic creed and poetry divine;<br />
True was my faith, and still your loves endure,<br />
The jewels of my fancy, bright and pure.<a name="page_369" id="page_369"></a><span class="pagenumb">{369}</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor only in fair places do I see</span><br />
The picture fair now it has ceased to be:<br />
For fate once led me, and myself some days<br />
Did I devote, to dull laborious ways,<br />
By soaring thought detained to tread full low,&mdash;<br />
Yea might I say unbeauteous paths of woe<br />
And dreary abodes, had not my youthful sprite<br />
Hallow'd each nook with legends of delight.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah! o'er that smoky town who looketh now</span><br />
By winter sunset from the dark hill-brow,<br />
Under the dying trees exultantly<br />
Nursing the sting of human tragedy?<br />
Or in that little room upstair'd so high,<br />
Where London's roofs in thickest huddle lie,<br />
Who now returns at evening to entice<br />
To his fireside the joys of Paradise?<br />
Once sacred was that hearth, and bright the air;<br />
The flame of man's redemption flickered there,<br />
In worship of those spirits, whose deathless fames<br />
Have thrilled the stars of heaven to hear their names;<br />
They that excell'd in wisdom to create<br />
Beauty, with mortal passion conquering fate;<br />
And, mid the sovran powers of elder time,<br />
The loveliness of music and new rhyme,<br />
The masters young that first enthrallÃ¨d me;<br />
Of whom if I should name, whom then but thee,<br />
Sweet Shelley, or the boy whose book was found<br />
Thrust in thy bosom on thy body drowned?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O mighty Muse, wooer of virgin thought,</span><br />
Beside thy charm all else counteth as nought;<br />
The revelation of thy smile doth make<br />
Him whom thou lovest reckless for thy sake;<br />
Earthborn of suffering, that knowest well<br />
To call thine own, and with enamouring spell<a name="page_370" id="page_370"></a><span class="pagenumb">{370}</span><br />
Feedest the stolen powers of godlike youth<br />
On dear imagination's only truth,<br />
Building with song a temple of desire;<br />
And with the yearning music of thy quire,<br />
In nuptial sacrament of thought and sense<br />
Hallowest for toil the hours of indolence:<br />
Thou in thy melancholic beauty drest,<br />
Subduest ill to serve thy fair behest,<br />
With tragic tears, and sevenfold purified<br />
Silver of mirth; and with extremest pride,<br />
With secret doctrine and unfathomed lore<br />
Remainest yet a child for evermore,<br />
The only enchantress of the earth that art<br />
To cheer his day and staunch man's bleeding heart.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O heavenly Muse, for heavenly thee we call</span><br />
Who in the fire of love refinest all,<br />
Accurst is he who heark'neth not thy voice;<br />
But happy he who, numbered of thy choice,<br />
Walketh aloof from nature's clouded plan:<br />
For all God's world is but the thought of man;<br />
Wherein hast thou re-formed a world apart,<br />
The mutual mirror of his better heart.<br />
There is no foulness, misery, nor sin,<br />
But he who loves finds his desire therein,<br />
And there with thee in lonely commerce lives:<br />
Nay, all that nature gave or fortune gives,<br />
Joys that his spirit is most jealous of,<br />
His only-embraced and best-deserving love,<br />
Who walketh in the noon of heavenly praise,<br />
The troubled godhead of his children's gaze,<br />
Wear thine eternity, and are loved best<br />
By thee transfigured and in thee possest;<br />
Who madest beauty, and from thy boundless store<br />
Of beauty shalt create for evermore.<br />

Gay Marigold is frolic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She laughs till summer is done;</span><br />
She hears the Grillie chirping<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All day i' the blazing sun.</span><br />
<br />
But when the pale moon rises,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She fain her face would hide;</span><br />
For the high Queen of sorrows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Disdains her empty pride.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Fair Primrose haunts the shadow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With children of the Spring,</span><br />
Till in the bloomy woodland<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The nightingale will sing.</span><br />
<br />
And when he lauds the May-night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spirits throng the grove,</span><br />
The moon shines thro' the branches<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And floods her heart with love.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />

Ye Spartan mothers, gentle ones,<br />
Of lion-hearted, loving sons,<br />
Fal'n, the flower of English youth,<br />
To a barbarous foe in a land uncouth:&mdash;<br />
<br />
O what a delicate sacrifice!<br />
Unequal the stake and costly the price<br />
As when the queen of Love deplor'd<br />
Her darling by the wild-beast gor'd.<a name="page_372" id="page_372"></a><span class="pagenumb">{372}</span><br />
<br />
They rode to war as if to the hunt,<br />
But ye at home, ye bore the brunt,<br />
Bore the siege of torturing fears,<br />
Fed your hope on the bread of tears.<br />
<br />
Proud and spotless warriors they<br />
With love or sword to lead the way;<br />
For ye had cradled heart and hand,<br />
The commander hearken'd to your command.<br />
<br />
Ah, weeping mothers, now all is o'er,<br />
Ye know your honour and mourn no more:<br />
Nor ask ye a name in England's story,<br />
Who gave your dearest for her glory.<br />

Strong-limb'd and tall, tossing thy wayward tresses,<br />
What mystery of the heart can so surprise<br />
The mirth and music of thy brimming eyes?<br />
<br />
Pale-brow, thou knowest not and diest to learn<br />

With look imploring 'If you love me, tell,<br />

I'd ask what BÃ©ranger found so sublime<br />
In that man's glory to adorn his rhyme.<br />
Was it mere fame?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">B.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Nay: for as wide a fame</span><br />
Was won by the gold-garnering millionaire,<br />
Who in the poet's verse might read his name<br />
And what is that? when so much froth and scum<br />
Float down the stream of Time (as Bacon saith),<br />
What is that for deliverance from the death?<br />
Could any sober man be proud to hold<br />
A lease of common talk, or die consoled<br />
For thinking that on lips of fools to come<br />
He'll live with Pontius Pilate and Tom Thumb?<br />
That were more like eternal punishment,<br />
The true fool's Paradise by all consent.<br />
BÃ©ranger thought to set a crown on merit.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">A.</span><br />
<br />
Man's merit! and to crown it in Voltaire?<br />
The modest eye, the gentle, fearless heart,<br />
The mouth of peace and truth, the angelic spirit!<br />
Why Arouet was <i>soufflÃ©</i> with the leaven,<a name="page_380" id="page_380"></a><span class="pagenumb">{380}</span><br />
Of which the little flock was bid beware:<br />
His very ambition was to play a part;<br />
Indifferent whether he did wrong or right,<br />
So he won credit; eager to deny<br />
A lie that failed, by adding lie to lie;<br />
Repaying evil unto seven-times-seven;<br />
A fount of slander, flattery and spite;<br />
Vain, irritable; true but to his face<br />
Of mockery and mischievous grimace,<br />
A monkey of the schools, the saints' despair!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">B.</span><br />
<br />
Yet for his voice half Europe stood at pause<br />
To hear, and when he spoke rang with applause.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">A.</span><br />
<br />
Granted he was a wonder of his kind.<br />
There is a devilish mockery in things<br />
Which only a born devil can enjoy.<br />
True banter is of melancholy mind,<br />
Akin to madness; thus must Shakespeare toy<br />
With Hamlet's reason, ere his fine art dare<br />
Push his relentless humour to the quick;<br />
And so his mortal thrusts pierce not the skin.<br />
But for the superficial bickerings<br />
That poison life and never seem to prick,<br />
The reasonable educated grin,<br />
Truly no wag is equal to Voltaire;<br />
His never-dying ripple, wide and light,<br />
Has nigh the force of Nature: to compare,<br />
'Tis like the ocean when the sky is bright,<br />
And the cold north-wind tickles with surprise<br />
The briny levels of the infinite sea.<br />
&mdash;Shall we conclude his merit was his wit,<br />
His magic art and versatility?<a name="page_381" id="page_381"></a><span class="pagenumb">{381}</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">B.</span><br />
<br />
And think of those foredoom'd in Dante's pit,<br />
Who, sunk at bottom of the loathly slough,<br />
Made the black mud up-bubble with their sighs;<br />
And all because they were unkind to Mirth,<br />
And went with smoky heart and gloomy brow<br />
The while they lived upon the pleasant earth<br />
In the sweet air that rallies to the sun,<br />
And ne'er so much as smiled or gave God thanks:<br />
Surely a sparkle of the Frenchman's fun<br />
Had rescued all their souls.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">A.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">I think I see</span><br />
The Deity who in this Heaven abides,<br />
<i>Le bon Dieu</i>, holding both his aching sides,<br />
With radiant face of Pan, ruddy and hairy:<br />
Give him his famous whistles and goat-shanks,<br />
And then present him to Alighieri.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">B.</span><br />
<br />
Nay, 'twixt the Frenchman and the Florentine<br />
I ask no truce, grave Dante weaving well<br />
His dark-eyed thought into a song divine,<br />
Drawing high poetry from heaven and hell&mdash;<br />
And him who lightly mockt at all in turn.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">A.</span><br />
<br />
It follow'd from his mundane thought of art<br />
That he contemn'd religion: his concern<br />
Was comfort, taste, and wit: he had no heart<br />
For man's attempt to build and beautify<br />
His home in Nature; so he set all by<br />
That wisdom had evolved with purpose kind;<a name="page_382" id="page_382"></a><span class="pagenumb">{382}</span><br />
Stamped it as folly, or as fraud attacked;<br />
Never discerning how his callow zest<br />
Was impiously defiling his own nest;<br />
Whereas the least philosophy may find<br />
The truths are the ideas; the sole fact<br />
Is the long story of man's growing mind.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">B.</span><br />
<br />
Upon your thistle now I see my fig&mdash;<br />
BÃ©ranger thought of Voltaire as a seer,<br />
A latter-day John Baptist in a wig;<br />
A herald of that furious gospel-storm<br />
Of words and blood, that made the nations fear;<br />
When sickening France adulterously sinn'd<br />
With Virtue, and went mad conceiving wind.<br />
He ranks him with those captains of reform,<br />
Luther and Calvin; who, whate'er they taught,<br />
Led folk from superstition to free thought.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">A.</span><br />
<br />
They did. But whence or whither led Voltaire?<br />
The steward with fifty talents given in charge,<br />
Who spent them on himself, and liv'd at large;<br />
His only virtue that he did not hide<br />
The pounds, but squander'd them to serve his pride;<br />
His praise that, cunning in his generation,<br />
He of the heavenly treasure did not spare<br />
To win himself an earthly habitation.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">B.</span><br />
<br />
Deny him not this laurel, nor to France<br />
The apostolate of modern tolerance:<br />
Their Theseus he, who slew the Minotaur,<br />
The Dragon Persecution, in which war<br />
He tipp'd the shafts that made the devil bleed;<a name="page_383" id="page_383"></a><span class="pagenumb">{383}</span><br />
And won a victory that hath overcome<br />
Many misdoings in a well-done deed;<br />
And more, I think, the mind of Christ revealing,<br />
Yea, more of common-sense and human feeling<br />
Than all the Creeds and Bulls of Christendom.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">A.</span><br />
<br />
Yet was he only one of them that slew:<br />
The fiend had taken a deadly wound from Bayle;<br />
And did he 'roar to see his kingdom fail'<br />
'Neath Robespierre, or raise his head anew?<br />
Nay, Voltaire's teaching never cured the heart:<br />
The lack of human feeling blots his art.<br />
When most his phrase with indignation burns,<br />
Still to the gallery his face he turns.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">B.</span><br />
<br />
You bear him hard. Men are of common stuff,<br />
Each hath some fault, and he had faults enough:<br />
But of all slanderers that ever were<br />
A virtuous critic is the most unfair.<br />
In greatness ever is some good to see;<br />
And what is character, unless it be<br />
The colour of persistent qualities,<br />
That, like a ground in painting, balances<br />
All hues and forms, combining with one tone<br />
Whatever lights or shades are on it thrown?<br />
Now Voltaire had of Nature a rich ground,<br />
Two virtues rarely in conjunction found:<br />
Industry, which no pedant could excel,<br />
He matched with gaiety inexhaustible;<br />
And with heroic courage held these fast,<br />
As sailors nail their colours to the mast,<br />
With ruling excellence atoning all.<br />
Though, for the rest, he still for praise may call;<a name="page_384" id="page_384"></a><span class="pagenumb">{384}</span><br />
Prudent to gain, as generous to share<br />
<i>Le superflu, chose si nÃ©cessaire</i>;<br />
To most a rare companion above scorn,<br />
To not a few a kind, devoted friend<br />
Through his long battling life, which in the end<br />
He strove with good works richly to adorn.<br />
I have admired, and why should I abuse<br />
A man who can so long and well amuse?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">A.</span><br />
<br />
To some Parisian art there's this objection,<br />
'Tis mediocrity pushed to perfection.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">B.</span><br />
<br />
'Judge not,' say I, 'and ye shall not be judged!'<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">A.</span><br />
<br />
Let me say, 'praise men, if ye would be praised:'<br />
Let your unwholesome flattery flow ungrudged,<br />
And with ungrudging measure shall men pour<br />
Their stifling homage back till ye be crazed,<br />
And sane men humour you as fools past cure.<br />
But these wise maxims deal not with the dead,<br />
'Tis by example that the young are led,<br />
And judgement owes its kindness but to them;<br />
Nor will I praise, call you me hard or nice,<br />
One that degraded art, and varnished vice.<br />
They that praise ill thereby themselves condemn.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">B.</span><br />
<br />
BÃ©ranger could not praise.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">A.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Few are who can;</span><br />
Not he: if ever he assay'd to impart<br />
A title loftier than his own renown,<a name="page_385" id="page_385"></a><span class="pagenumb">{385}</span><br />
Native irreverence defied his art,<br />
His fingers soil'd the lustre of his crown.<br />
Here he adored what he was envious of,<br />
The vogue and dazzling fashion of the man.<br />
But man's true praise, the poet's praise, is love.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">B.</span><br />
<br />
And that, perhaps, was hardly his affair....<br />
Pray, now, what set you talking of Voltaire?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;">A.</span><br />
<br />
This only, that in weeding out my shelves,<br />
In fatherly regard for babes upgrown,<br />
Until they learn to garden for themselves,<br />
Much as I like to keep my sets entire,<br />
When I came out to you I had just thrown<br />
Three of his precious works behind the fire.<br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 8%;">TO ROBERT BURNS</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10%;"><small>AN EPISTLE ON INSTINCT</small></span><br />&nbsp;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>1</small></span><br />
<br />
Thou art a poet, Robbie Burns,<br />
Master of words and witty turns,<br />
Of lilting songs and merry yarns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drinking and kissing:</span><br />
There's much in all thy small concerns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But more that's missing.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>2</small></span><br />

<br />
The wisdom of thy common sense,<br />
Thy honest hate of vain pretence,<br />
Thy love and wide benevolence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full often lead thee</span><br />
Where feeling is its own defence;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet while I read thee,<a name="page_386" id="page_386"></a><span class="pagenumb">{386}</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>3</small></span><br />

<br />
It seems but chance that all our race<br />
Trod not the path of thy disgrace,<br />
And, living freely to embrace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The moment's pleasure,</span><br />
Snatch'd not a kiss of Nature's face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For all her treasure.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>4</small></span><br />

<br />
The feelings soft, the spirits gay<br />
Entice on such a flowery way,<br />
And sovran youth in high heyday<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath such a fashion</span><br />
To glorify the bragging sway<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of sensual passion.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>5</small></span><br />

<br />
But rakel Chance and Fortune blind<br />
Had not the power:&mdash;Eternal Mind<br />
Led man upon a way design'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By strait selection</span><br />
Of pleasurable ways, to find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Severe perfection.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>6</small></span><br />

<br />
For Nature did not idly spend<br />
Pleasure: she ruled it should attend<br />
On every act that doth amend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our life's condition:</span><br />
'Tis therefore not well-being's end,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But its fruition.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>7</small></span><br />

<br />
Beasts that inherited delight<br />
In what promoted health or might,<br />
Survived their cousins in the fight:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If some&mdash;like Adam&mdash;</span><br />
Prefer'd the wrong tree to the right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The devil had 'em.<a name="page_387" id="page_387"></a><span class="pagenumb">{387}</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>8</small></span><br />

<br />
So when man's Reason took the reins,<br />
She found that she was saved her pains;<br />
She had but to approve the gains<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of agelong inscience,</span><br />
And spin it fresh into her brains<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As moral conscience.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>9</small></span><br />

<br />
But Instinct in the beasts that live<br />
Is of three kinds; (Nature did give<br />
To man three shakings in her sieve)&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The first is Racial,</span><br />
The second Self-preservative,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The third is Social.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>10</small></span><br />

<br />
Without the first no race could be,<br />
So 'tis the strongest of the three;<br />
Nay, of such forceful tyranny<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis hard to attune it,</span><br />
Because 'twas never made to agree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To serve the unit:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>11</small></span><br />

<br />
Art will not picture it, its name<br />
In common talk is utter shame:<br />
And yet hath Reason learn'd to tame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its conflagration</span><br />
Into a sacramental flame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of consecration.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>12</small></span><br />

<br />
Those hundred thousand years, ah me!<br />
Of budding soul! What slow degree,<br />
With aim so dim, so true! We see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now that we know them,</span><br />
Our humble cave-folk ancestry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How much we owe them:<a name="page_388" id="page_388"></a><span class="pagenumb">{388}</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>13</small></span><br />

<br />
While with the savage beasts around<br />
They fought at odds, yet underground<br />
Their miserable life was sound;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their loves and quarrels</span><br />
Did well th' ideal bases found<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of art and morals:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>14</small></span><br />

<br />
One prime distinction, Good and Ill,<br />
Was all their notion, all their skill;&mdash;<br />
But Unity stands next to Nil;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Want of analysis</span><br />
Saved them from doubts that wreck the Will<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With pale paralysis.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>15</small></span><br />

<br />
In vain philosophers dispute<br />
'Is Good or Pleasure our pursuit?'&mdash;<br />
The fruit likes man, not man the fruit;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The good that likes him,</span><br />
The good man's pleasure 'tis to do 't;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That's how it strikes him.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>16</small></span><br />

<br />
Tho' Science hide beneath her feet<br />
The point where moral reasonings meet,<br />
The vicious circle is complete;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is no lodgement</span><br />
Save Aristotle's own retreat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The just man's judgement.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>17</small></span><br />

<br />
And if thou wert not that just man,<br />
Wild Robin, born to crown his plan,<br />
We shall not for that matter ban<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy petty treason,</span><br />
Nor closely thy defection scan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From highest Reason.<a name="page_389" id="page_389"></a><span class="pagenumb">{389}</span></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 18%;"><small>18</small></span><br />

<br />
Thou might'st have lived like Robin Hood<br />
Waylaying Abbots in the wood,<br />
Doing whate'er thee-seemÃ¨d good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The law defying,</span><br />
And 'mong the people's heroes stood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Living and dying:</span><br />

Yet better bow than his thou bendest,<br />

Sharply the arrow home thou sendest;<br />

So pity it is thou knew'st the teen<br />
Of sad remorse: the Might-have-been<br />
Shall not o'ercloud thy merry scene<br />

Nor forfeit from thy spirit keen<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1%;">AN INVITATION TO THE OXFORD<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PAGEANT, JULY 1907</span><br />&nbsp;<br />

Fair lady of learning, playfellow of spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who to thy towery hospice in the vale</span><br />
Invitest all, with queenly claim to bring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scholars from every land within thy pale;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If aught our pageantry may now avail</span><br />
To paint thine antique story to the eye,<br />
Inspire the scene, and bid thy herald cry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Welcome to all, and to all comers hail!</span><br />
<br />
Come hither, then he crieth, and hail to all.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bow each his heart a pilgrim at her shrine,</span><br />
Whatever chance hath led you to my call,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ye that love pomp, and ye that seek a sign,<a name="page_391" id="page_391"></a><span class="pagenumb">{391}</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or on the low earth look for things divine;</span><br />
Nor ye, whom reverend Camus near-allied,<br />
Writes in the roll of his ennobled pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Refrain your praise and love to mix with mine.</span><br />
<br />
Praise her, the mother of celestial moods,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who o'er the saints' inviolate array</span><br />
Hath starr'd her robe of fair beatitudes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With jewels worn by Hellas, on the day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She grew from girlhood into wisdom gay;</span><br />
And hath laid by her crozier, evermore<br />
With both hands gathering to enrich her store,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And make her courts with music ring alway.</span><br />
<br />
Love her, for that the world is in her heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Man's rude antiquity and doubtful goal,</span><br />
The heaven-enthralling luxury of art,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The burden'd pleading of his clay-bound soul,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mutual office of delight and dole,</span><br />
The merry laugh of youth, the joy of life<br />
Older than thought, and the unamending strife<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twixt liberty and politic control.</span><br />
<br />
There is none holier, not the lilied town<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By Arno, whither the spirit of Athens fled,</span><br />
Escap't from Hades to a less renown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet joyful to be risen from the dead;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor she whose wide imperious arms were spread</span><br />
To spoil mankind, until the avenger came<br />
In darkening storm, and left a ruin'd name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A triple crown, upon a vanquish't head.</span><br />
<br />
What love in myriad hearts in every clime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The vision of her beauty calls to pray'r:</span><br />
Where at his feet HimÃ¢laya sublime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Holds up aslope the Arabian floods, or where<a name="page_392" id="page_392"></a><span class="pagenumb">{392}</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Patriarchal Nile rears at his watery stair;</span><br />
In the broad islands of the Antipodes,<br />
By Esperanza, or in the coral seas<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Buddha's vain pagodas throng the air;</span><br />
<br />
Or where the chivalry of Nipon smote<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wily Muscovite, intent to creep</span><br />
Around the world with half his pride afloat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sent his battle to the soundless deep;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or with our pilgrim-kin, and them that reap</span><br />
The prairie-corn beyond cold Labrador<br />
To California and the Alaskan shore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her exiled sons their pious memory keep:</span><br />

Bright memories of young poetic pleasure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In free companionship, the loving stress</span><br />
Of all life-beauty lull'd in studious leisure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When every Muse was jocund with excess</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of fine delight and tremulous happiness;</span><br />
The breath of an indolent unbridled June,<br />
When delicate thought fell from the dreamy moon:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now strange care, sorrow, and grief oppress.</span><br />
<br />
'<i>Ah! fewer tears shall be</i>,&mdash;'tis thus they dream,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Ah, fewer, softer tears, when we lie low:</i></span><br />
<i>On younger brows shall brighter laurel gleam:</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Lovelier and earlier shall the rosebuds blow</i>.'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For in this hope she nurs'd them, and to know</span><br />
That Truth, while men regard a tetter'd page,<br />
Leaps on the mountains, and from age to age<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reveals the dayspring's inexhausted glow.</span><br />
<br />
Yet all their joy is mingled with regret:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the lone scholar on a neighbouring height,</span><br />
Brooding disconsolate with eyelids wet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere o'er the unkind world he took his flight,<a name="page_393" id="page_393"></a><span class="pagenumb">{393}</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Look'd down upon her festal lamps at night,</span><br />
And while the far call of her warning bell<br />
Reach't to his heart, sang us his fond farewell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the stars thinking of lost delight;</span><br />
<br />
'Farewell! for whether we be young or old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou dost remain, but we shall pass away:</span><br />
Time shall against himself thy house uphold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And build thy sanctuary from decay;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Children unborn shall be thy pride and stay.</span><br />
May Earth protect thee, and thy sons be true;<br />
And God with heavenly food thy life renew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy pleasure and thy grace from day to day.'</span><br />&nbsp;<br />

Lament, O Muse of the Thames, in pride lament again,<br />
With low melodious grief remember them in this hour!&mdash;<br />

<div class="blockquot">
<p>These experiments in quantitive verse were made in fulfilment of
a promise to William Johnson Stone that I would some day test his
theory. His premature death converted my consent into a serious
obligation. This personal explanation is due to myself for two reasons:
because I might otherwise appear firstly as an advocate of the system,
secondly as responsible for Stone's determination of the lengths of
English syllables. Before writing quantitive verse it is necessary to
learn to <i>think</i> in quantities. This is no light task, and a beginner requires
fixed rules. Except for a few minor details, which I had disputed with
Mr. Stone, I was bound to take his rules as he had elaborated them; and
it was not until I had made some progress and could think fairly well
in his prosody that I seriously criticized it. The two chief errors that
I find in it are that he relied too much on the quality of a vowel in
determining its syllabic length, and that he regarded the <i>h</i> as <i>always</i>
consonantal in quality. His valuation of the <i>er</i> sound is doubtful, but
defensible and convenient, and I have never discarded it. My earlier
experiments contain therefore a good many 'false quantities', and these,
where they could not be very easily (though <i>inconsistently</i>) amended, I
have left, and marked most of them in the text: a few false quantities do
not make a poem less readable. Thus a long mark over a syllable
means that Stone reckoned it as long, and that the verse requires it to be
so pronounced, but that I regard it as short, or at least as <i>doubtful</i>.
For example on p. 414 <i>R&#363;in</i> is thus written. Of all accented long
vowels in 'open' position the long <i>u</i> seems perhaps to retain its
quantity best, but there is evidence that Tennyson held it to be shortened,
and I do not know whether it might be an exception or go with th&#277;ory,
p&#301;ety, p&#335;etry, &amp;c. Again, where a final syllable should be lengthened or
not shortened by position, but lacks its consonantal support, I have put
a<sup>v</sup> in the gap: these weak places are chiefly due to my accepting Stone's
unchanging valuation of <i>h</i>. My emancipation from Stone's rules was
gradual, so that I have not been able to distinguish definitely my earlier
experiments from the later, in which the quantities are such as I have
now come to approve of: but my line-for-line paraphrase of Virgil is
such a later experiment. It was accompanied in the <i>New Quarterly</i> by
a long examination of the Virgilian hexameter, to which I would refer
any one who is interested in the subject. In these English hexameters
I have used and advocate the use of Miltonic elision. The mark ' in the
text shows where I have purposely allowed a short syllable to sustain
a long place. Though the difficulty of adapting our English syllables
to the Greek rules is very great, and even deterrent&mdash;for I cannot pretend
to have attained to an absolutely consistent scheme&mdash;yet the experiments
that I have made reveal a vast unexplored field of delicate and expressive
rhythms hitherto unknown in our poetry: and this amply rewarded me
for my friendly undertaking.</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 10%;">WINTRY DELIGHTS</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />

Now in wintry delights, and long fireside meditation,<br />
'Twixt studies and routine paying due court to the Muses,<br />
My solace in solitude, when broken roads barricade me<br />
Mudbound, unvisited for months with my merry children,<br />
Grateful t'ward Providence, and heeding a slander against me<br />
Less than a rheum, think of me to-day, dear L&#299;onel, and take<br />
This letter as some account of Will Stone's versification.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We, whose first memories reach half of a century backward,</span><br />
May praise our fortune to have outliv'd so many dangers,&mdash;<br />
Faultiness of Nature's unruly machinery or man's&mdash;;   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
For, once born, whatever 'tis worth, <span class="smcap">LIFE</span> is to be held to,<br />
Its mere persistence esteem'd as r&#275;al attainment,<br />
Its crown of silver reverenc'd as one promise of youth<br />
Fruiting, of existence one needful purpose accomplish'd:<br />
And 'twere worth the living, howe'er unkindly bereft of<br />
Those joys and comforts, throu' which we chiefly regard it:<br />
Nay,&mdash;set aside the pleasant unhinder'd order of our life,<br />
Our happy enchantments of Fortune, easy surroundings,<br />
Courteous acquaintance, dwelling in fair homes, the delight of<br />
Long-plann'd excursions, the romance of journeying in lands<br />
Historic, of s&#275;eing their glory, the famous adornments   <span class="linenum">21</span><br />
Giv'n to memorial Earth by man, decorator of all-time,<br />
(&mdash;As w&#275; saw with virginal eyes travelling to behold them,&mdash;)<br />
Her gorgeous palaces,<sup>v</sup>her tow'rs and stately cathedrals;<br />
Where the turrets and domes of pictured Tuscany slumber,<a name="page_412" id="page_412"></a><span class="pagenumb">{412}</span><br />
Or the havoc'd splendours of Rome imperial, or where<br />
Glare the fretted minarets and mosks of trespassing Islam,<br />
And old Nilus, amid the mummied suzerainty of Egypt,<br />
Glideth, a godly presence, consciously regardless of all things,<br />
Save his unending toil and &#275;ternal recollections:&mdash;   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Set these out of account, and with them too put away <span class="smcap">ART</span>,</span><br />
Those ravishings of mind, those sensuous intelligences,<br />
By whose grace the elect enjoy their sacred aloofness<br />
From Life's meagre affairs, in beauty's r&#275;generate youth<br />
Reading immortality's sublime revelation, adoring<br />
Their own heav'nly desire; nor alone in worship assist they,<br />
But take, call'd of God, part and pleasure in cr&#275;ation<br />
Of that beauty, the first of His first purposes extoll'd:&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yea, set aside with these all <span class="smcap">Nature's</span> beauty, the wildwood's</span><br />
Flow'ry domain, the flushing, softcrowding loveliness of Spring,   <span class="linenum">40</span><br />
Lazy Summer's burning d&#299;al, the serenely solemn spells<br />
Of Sibylline Autumn, with gay-wing'd Plenty departing;<br />
All fair change, whether of seasons or bright recurrent day,<br />
Morning or eve; the divine night's wonderous empyrean;<br />
High noon's melting azure, his thin cloud-country, the landscape<br />
Mountainous or maritime, blue calms of midsummer Ocean,<br />
Broad corn-grown champaign goldwaving in invisible wind,<br />
Wide-water'd pasture, with shade of whispering aspen;<br />
All whereby Nature winneth our love, fondly appearing<br />
As to caress her children, or all that in exaltation   <span class="linenum">50</span><br />
Lifteth aloft our hearts to an unseen glory beyond her:&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Put these out of account; yea, more I say, banish also</span><br />
From the credit s&#365;m of enjoyment those simple <span class="smcap">AFFECTIONS</span>,<br />
Whose common exercise informs our natural instinct;<br />
That, set in our animal flesh-fabric, of our very lifeblood<br />
Draw their subsistence, and even in ungenerous hearts<a name="page_413" id="page_413"></a><span class="pagenumb">{413}</span><br />
Root, like plants in stony deserts and 'neath pitiless snows.<br />
Yea, put away all <span class="smcap">Love</span>, the blessings and p&#299;eties<sup>v</sup>of home,<br />
All delicate heart-bonds, vital tendernesses untold,<br />
Joys that fear to be named, feelings too holy to gaze on;   <span class="linenum">60</span><br />
And with his inviolate peace-tr&#299;umph his passionate war<br />
Be forgone, his mighty desire, thrilling ecstasies, ardours<br />
Of mystic reverence, his fierce flame-eager emotions,<br />
Idolatrous service, blind faith and ritual of fire.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If from us all these things were taken away, (that is all art</span><br />
And all beauty whate'er, and all love's varied affection,)<br />
Yet would enough subsist in other concerns to suffice us,<br />
And feed intelligence, and make life's justification.<br />
What this is, if you should ask me, beyond or above the rejoicing<br />
In vegetant or brute existence, answer is easy;   <span class="linenum">70</span><br />
'Tis the reflective effort of mind that, conscious of itself,<br />
Fares forth exploring nature for principle and cause,<br />
Keenly with all the cunning pleasure and instinct of a hunter,<br />
Who, in craft fashioning weapon and sly snare, tracketh after<br />
His prey fly&#772;ing afield, and that which his arm killeth eateth.<br />
<br />
History and <span class="smcap">SC;I&#772;ENCE</span> our playthings are: what an untold<br />
Wealth of inexhaustive treasure is stored up for amusement!<br />
Shall the amass'd Earth-structure appeal to me less than in early<br />
Childhood an old fives-ball, whose wraps I wondering unwound,<br />
Untwining the ravel'd worsted, that mere rubbish and waste<br />
Of leather and shavings had bound and moulded elastic   <span class="linenum">81</span><br />
Into a perfect sphere? Shall not the celestial earth-ball<br />
Equally entertain a mature enquiry, reward our<br />
Examination of its contexture, conglomerated<br />
Of layer'd dÃ©bris, the erosion of infinite ages?<br />
Tho' I lack the wizard Darwin's sc&#299;entific insight<br />
On the barren sea-beaches of East Patagonia gazing,<a name="page_414" id="page_414"></a><span class="pagenumb">{414}</span><br />
I must wond'ring attend, nay learn myself to decipher<br />
Time's rich h&#299;eroglyph, with vast elemental pencil<br />
Scor'd upon Earth's rocky crust,&mdash;minute shells slowly collecting   <span class="linenum">90</span><br />
Press'd to a stone, uprais'd to a mountain, again to a fine sand<br />
Worn, burying the remains of an alien organic epoch,<br />
In the flat accretions of new sedimentary strata;<br />
All to be crush'd, crumpled, confused, contorted, abandon'd,<br />
Broke, as a child's puzzle is, to be recompos'd with attention;<br />
Nature's history-book, which sh&#275; hath torn as asham'd of;<br />
And lest those pictures on<sup>v</sup>her fragmentary pages<br />
Should too lightly reveal frustrate Antiquity, hath laid<br />
R&#363;in upon r&#363;in, revolution upon revolution:<br />
Yet no single atom, no least insignificant grain   <span class="linenum">100</span><br />
But, having order alike of fate, and faulty disorder,<br />
Holds a record of Time, very vestiges of the Creation;<br />
Which who will not attend scorns blindly the only commandments<br />
By God's finger of old inscribed on table of earth-stone.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This for me wer' enough: yet confin'd G&#275;ology's field</span><br />
Counts not in all Sc&#299;ence more than the planet to the Cosmos;<br />
Where our central Sun, almighty material author,<br />
And sustainer, appears as a half-consumed vanishing spark,<br />
Bearing along with it, entangled in immensity's onward<br />
Spiral eddies, the blacken'd dust-motes whirl'd off from around it.   <span class="linenum">110</span><br />
But tho' man's microscopical functions measure all things<br />
By his small footprints, finger-spans and ticking of clocks,<br />
And thereby conceive the immense&mdash;such multiple extent<br />
As to defy Id&#275;as of imperative cerebration,&mdash;<br />
None the less observing, measuring, patiently recording,<br />
H&#275; mappeth out the utter wilderness of unlimited space;<br />
Carefully weigheth a weight to the sun, reckoneth for it its path<br />
Of trackless travelling, the precise momentary places<a name="page_415" id="page_415"></a><span class="pagenumb">{415}</span><br />
Of the planets and their satellites, their annual orbits,<br />
Times, perturbations of times, and orbit of orbit.   <span class="linenum">120</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What was Alexander's subduing of Asia, or that</span><br />
Sheep-worry of Europe, when pigmy Napoleon enter'd<br />
Her sovereign chambers, and her kings with terror eclips'd?<br />
His footsore soldiers inciting across the ravag'd plains,<br />
Thro' bloody fields of death tramping to an ugly disaster?<br />
Shows any crown, set above the promise (so rudely accomplisht)<br />
Of their fair godlike young faces, a glory to compare<br />
With the immortal olive that circles bold Galileo's<br />
Brows, the laurel'd halo<sup>v</sup>of Newton's unwithering fame?   <span class="linenum">129</span><br />
Or what a child's surmise, how trifling a journey Columbus<br />
Adventur'd, to a land like that which he sail'd from arriving,<br />
If compar'd to Bessel's magic divination, awarding<br />
Magnificent Sirius<sup>v</sup>his dark and invisible bride;<br />
Or when Adams by Cam, (more nearly Leverrier in France,)<br />
From the minutely measur'd vacillation of Uranus, augur'd<br />
Where his mighty brother Neptune went wandering unnamed,<br />
And thro' those thousand-million league-darknesses of space<br />
Drew him slowly whene'er he pass'd, and slowly released him!<br />
<i>Nil admirari!</i> 'Tis surely a most shabby thinker    <span class="linenum">139</span><br />
Who, looking on Nature, finds not the reflection appalling<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And if these wonders we must with wonder abandon,</span><br />
Astronomy's Cosmos, the Immense, and those physical laws<br />
That link mind to matter, laws mutual in revelation,<br />
Which measure and analyse Nature's primordial orgasm,<br />
Lifegiving omnipotential <span class="smcap">Light</span>, its speed to determine,<br />
Untwist its rainbow of various earthcoloring rays,<br />
Counting strictly to each its own millionth-millimetred<br />
Wave-length, and mapping out on fray'd diffraction of ether<br />
All the adust elements and furnaced alchemy of<sup>v</sup>heav'n;<br />
Laws which atone the disorder of infinit observation   <span class="linenum">150</span><br />
With tyrannous numbers and abstract theory, closing<a name="page_416" id="page_416"></a><span class="pagenumb">{416}</span><br />
Protean Nature with nets of principle exact;<br />
Her metamorphoses transmuting by correlation,<br />
All heat, all chemical concourse or electrical action,<br />
All force and all motion of all matter, or subtle or gross:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If we these wonders, I say, with wonder abandon,</span><br />
Nor can for mental heaviness their high study pursue,<br />
Yet no story of adventures or fabulous exploit<br />
Of famous'd heroes hath so r&#333;mantic a discourse,<br />
As these growing annals of long heav'n-scaling achievement<br />
And far discoveries, which he who<sup>v</sup>idly neglecteth   <span class="linenum">161</span><br />
Is but a boor as truly ridiculous as the village clown,<br />
In whose thought the pleasant sun-ball performeth a circuit<br />
Daily above mother earth, and resteth nightly beneath her.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor will a man, whose mind respects its own operations,</span><br />
Lightly resign himself to remain in darkness uninform'd,<br />
While any true sc&#299;ence of fact lies easy within reach<br />
Concerning Nature's &#275;ternal essential object,<br />
Self-matter, embodying substratum of ev'ry relation<br />
Both of Time and Space, at once the machinery and stuff<br />
Of those Id&#275;as; carrier, giver, only receiver   <span class="linenum">171</span><br />
Of such perceptions as arise in sensible organs.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now whether each element is a c&#333;herency of equal</span><br />
Strictly symmetric atoms, or among themselves the atoms are<br />
Like animals in a herd, having each an identity distinct,<br />
&mdash;So that atoms of gold compar'd with sulphur or iron<br />
Are but as ancient Greeks compar'd with Chinamen and Turks;&mdash;<br />
Nor whether all elements are untransmutable offspring<br />
From one kind or more thro' endless eternity changing,<br />
Or whether invisibles claim rightly the name of immortals,<br />
I make no<sup>v</sup>enquiry; matter minutely divided   <span class="linenum">181</span><br />
Showing a like paradox, with ever-continuous extent,<br />
And, as Adam, the atom will pose as a naked assumption:&mdash;<br />
But since all the knowledge which man was born to attain to<br />
Hath these only channels, (which must limit and qualify<sup>v</sup>it,)<a name="page_417" id="page_417"></a><span class="pagenumb">{417}</span><br />
We shall con the grammar, the material alphabet of life,<br />
Yea, ev'n more from error to preserve our inquisitive mind,<br />
Than to secure well-b&#275;ing against adversity and ill.<br />
Surely if all is a flux, 'tis well to look into the fl&#363;id,<br />
Inspect and question the apparent, shifty behaviour,   <span class="linenum">190</span><br />
Wherein lurketh alone our witness of all physical law,<br />
As we read the habits unchanging of invisible things,<br />
Their timeless chronicles, the unintelligent ethic of dust:<br />
In which dense labyrinth he who was guiding avised me,<br />
With caution saying 'Were this globe's area of land<br />
Wholly cover'd from sight, pack'd close to the watery margins<br />
With mere empty vessels, I could myself put in each one<br />
Some different substance, and write its formula thereon.'<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus would speak the chemist; and Nature's superabundance,</span><br />
Her vast infinitude of waste v&#257;riety untold,   <span class="linenum">200</span><br />
As<sup>v</sup>her immense extent and inconceivable object,<br />
Squandering activities throughout &#275;ternity, dwarfeth<br />
Man's little aim and hour, his doubtful fancy: what are we?<br />
Our petty selfseekings, our speedily passing affections?<br />
Life having existed so extravagantly before us;<br />
Earth bearing so slight a regard or care for us; and all<br />
After us unconcern'd to remain, strange, beautiful as now.<br />
May not an idle echo<sup>v</sup>of an antique p&#333;etry haunt me,<br />
'Friendship is all feigning, yea<sup>v</sup>all loving is folly only'?<br />
&mdash;Yet doth not very mention of antique p&#333;etry and love   <span class="linenum">210</span><br />
Quickly recall to better motions my dispirited faith?<br />
And I see man's discontent as witness asserting<br />
His moral id&#275;al, that, born of Nature, is heir to<br />
Her children's titles, which nought may cancel or impugn;<br />
Not wer' of all her works man least, but ranking among them<br />
Highly or ev'n as best, he wrongs himself to imagine<br />
His soul foe to her aim, or from<sup>v</sup>her sanction an outlaw.<a name="page_418" id="page_418"></a><span class="pagenumb">{418}</span><br />
Nay, but just as man should appear more fully accordant<br />
With things not himself, would they rank with<sup>v</sup>him as equals:<br />
Judging other creatures he sets them wholly beneath him;<br />
His disqu&#299;et among manifold and alien objects   <span class="linenum">221</span><br />
B&#275;ing sure evidence, the effect of an understanding,<br />
And perception allow'd by Nature solely to himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Highly then is to be prais'd the resourceful wisdom of our time,</span><br />
That spunged out the written science and th&#275;ories of life,<br />
And, laying foundation of its knowledge in physical law,<br />
Gave it pr&#275;eminence o'er all enquiry, erecting<br />
Superstructive of all, bringing ev'ry research to the object,<br />
Boldly a new sc&#299;ence of MAN, from dreamy scholastic<br />
Imprisoning set free, and inveterate divination,   <span class="linenum">230</span><br />
Into the light of truth, to the touch of history and fact.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since 'the proper study of mankind is man',&mdash;nor aforetime</span><br />
Was the proverb esteem'd as a truism less than it is now,&mdash;<br />
'Tis strange that the method lay out of sight unaccomplisht,<br />
And that we, so late to arrive, should first set a value<br />
On the delusive efforts of human babyhood; and so<br />
Witnessing impatiently the rear of their disappearance,<br />
Upgathering the relics and vestiges of primitive man,<br />
Should ratify<sup>v</sup>instinct for sc&#299;ence, look to the darkness<br />
For light, find a knowledge where 'twas most groping or unknown:    <span class="linenum">240</span><br />
While civilization's advances mutely regarding<br />
Talk we of old scapegoats, discuss bloodrites, immolations,<br />
Worship of ancestors; explain complexities involved<br />
Of tribal marriages, derivation of early religions,<br />
Priestly taboos, totems, archaic mysteries of trees,<br />
All the devils and dreams abhorr'd of barbarous ages.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And 'tis a far escape from wires, wheels and penny papers</span><br />
And the worried congestion of our Victorian era,<a name="page_419" id="page_419"></a><span class="pagenumb">{419}</span><br />
Whose many inventions of world-wide luxury have changed<br />
Life's very face:&mdash;but enough w&#275; hear of progress, enough have   <span class="linenum">250</span><br />
Our conscious sc&#299;ence and comforts trumpeted; altho'<br />
Hardly can I, who so many years eagerly frequented<br />

Kind old <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>, howe'er h&#275;; slumbereth, entomb'd<br />
'Neath the shatter'd winejars and r&#363;ined factories of Cos,<br />

No<sup>v</sup>art or sc&#299;ence grew so contemptible, order'd   <span class="linenum">259</span><br />

Nor when here and there some ray, in darkness arising,<br />
Hopefully seem'd to herald the coming dawn, (as when a Laennec<br />
Or Jenner invented his meed of worthy remembrance,)<br />
Did one mind foresee, one seer foretell the appearance<br />
Of that unexpected daylight that arose upon our time.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who dream'd that living air poison'd our <span class="smcap">SURGERY</span>, coating</span><br />
All our sheeny weapons with germs of an invisible death,   <span class="linenum">270</span><br />

Quickly as its warring scimitars of victory had slain?<br />
Saw what school-tradition for nature's kind method admir'd,<br />

Forgotten, or condemn'd as want of care in a surgeon?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tho' <span class="smcap">Medicine</span> makes not so plain an appeal to the vulgar,</span><br />

And yet in all mankind's disappointed history, now first<br />
Have<sup>v</sup>his scouts push'd surely within<sup>v</sup>his foul enemies' lines,<br />
And his sharpshooters descried their insidious foe,<br />
Those swarming parasites, that barely within the detection<br />

Thro' man's brain and limbs, slaying with loathly pollution<br />
His beauty's children,<sup>v</sup>his sweet sc&#299;ons of affection,   <span class="linenum">300</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With what wildly directed attack, what an armory illjudged,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis success that attracts: 'twas therefore so many workers</span><br />
Ran pellmell to the schools of Nature in our generation,   <span class="linenum">320</span><br />
While other employments have lack'd their genius and pined.<br />
Our fathers' likings w&#275; thought semibarbarous, our art<br />
Self-consciously sickens in qualms of an Ã¦sthetic aura,<br />
Noisily in the shallows splashing and disporting uninspir'd.<br />
Our famed vulgarities whether in speech, taste or amusement,<br />
Are not amended: Is it foolish, hoping for a rescue,<br />
First to appeal to the strong, for health to the healthy amongst us?<br />
&mdash;For the Sophists' doctrine that <span class="smcap">Grace</span> is dying of old age<br />
I hold in derision, their inkpot th&#275;ories of man,<br />
Of his cradle of art, his deathbed of algebra;&mdash;and see   <span class="linenum">330</span><br />
How Sc&#299;ence has wrought, since we went idling at Eton,<br />
One thing above surmise:&mdash;An' if I may dare to remind you<br />
How Vergil praises your lov'd Lucretius, (of whom<br />
My matter and metre<sup>v</sup>have set you thinking, as I fear,)<br />
In that glory which ends 'et inexorabile fatum<br />
Subjecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis avari':<br />
Sounded not most empty to us such boast of a pagan,<br />
Strangely to us tutor'd to believe, with faith mediÃ¦val,<br />
Torture everlasting to be justly the portion of all souls,<br />
Nor but by the elects' secret pr&#275;destiny escaped?   <span class="linenum">340</span><br />
If you think to reply,&mdash;making this question in answer,&mdash;<br />
'Did the belief disturb for a moment our pleasure in life?'<br />
No.&mdash;And men gather in harvest on slopes of an active<br />
Volcano: natheless the terror's &#275;normity was there;<br />
Now 'tis away: Sc&#299;ence has pierced man's cloudy common-sense,<br />
Dow'rd his homely vision with more expansive an embrace,<br />
And the rotten foundation of old superstition exposed.<br />
That trouble of Pascal, those vain paradoxes of Austin,<br />
Those Semitic parables of Paul, those tomes of Aquinas,<a name="page_422" id="page_422"></a><span class="pagenumb">{422}</span><br />
All are thrown to the limbo of antediluvian idols,   <span class="linenum">350</span><br />
Only because we learn mankind's true history, and know<br />
That not at all from a high perfection sinfully man fell,<br />
But from baseness arose: We have with sympathy enter'd<br />
Those dark caves, his joyless abodes, where with ravening brutes,<br />
Bear or filthy hyena, he once disputed a shelter:&mdash;<br />
That was his Paradise, his garden of Eden,&mdash;abandon'd<br />
Ages since to the drift and drip, the cementing accretions<br />
Whence we now separate his bones buried in the stalagma,<br />
His household makeshifts, his hunting tools, his adornments,<br />
From the scatter'd skeletons of a lost prehistoric order,   <span class="linenum">360</span><br />
Its mammoth and woolly rhinoceros, the machairodos, and beasts<br />
Whose unnamed pastures the immense Atlantic inundates.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In what corner of earth lie not dispersed the familiar</span><br />
Flinty relics of his old primitive stone-cutlery? what child<br />
Kens not now the design, the adapted structure of each one<br />
Of those hand-labor'd chert-flakes, whether axe, chisel, or knife,<br />
Spearhead, barb of arrow, rough plane or rudely serrate saw?<br />
Stones that in our grandsires' time told no sermon, (awaiting<br />
Indestructible, unnumber'd, on chary attention,)<br />
From their pr&#275;adamite pulpits now cry Revelation.   <span class="linenum">370</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not to a Greek his chanted epic had mortal allurement,</span><br />
Conjuring old-world fancies of Ilium and of Olympus,<br />
As this story to me, this tale primÃ¦val of unsung,<br />
Unwritten, ancestral fate and adversity, this siege<br />
Of courage and happiness protracted so many thousand<br />
Thousand years in a slow persistent victory of brain<br />
And right hand o'er all the venom'd stings, sharpnesses of fang<br />
And dread fury whate'er Nature, tirelessly devising,<br />
Could develop with tooth, claw, tusk, or horn to oppose them.<br />
See now Herakles, who strangled snakes when an infant   <span class="linenum">380</span><br />
In<sup>v</sup>his cradle alone; and nought but those petty stonechips<a name="page_423" id="page_423"></a><span class="pagenumb">{423}</span><br />
For the battle: 'twas wonder above wonders his achievement:<br />
Yea, and since he thought as a child 'twas natural in<sup>v</sup>him,<br />
Meeting in existence with purposes antagonistic,<br />
Circumstances oppos'd to desire, vast activities, which<br />
Thwarted effort, to assume All-might as spiteful against him.<br />
Nay, as an artist born, impell'd to devise a religion,&mdash;<br />
So to relate himself id&#275;ally with the immortal,&mdash;<br />
This quarrel of reason with what displeas'd his affections<br />
Was not amiss. The desire and love of beauty possess man:<br />
Art is of all that beauty the best outwardly presented;   <span class="linenum">391</span><br />
Truth to the soul is merely the best that mind can imagine.<br />
No lover &#275;ternal will hold to an older opinion<br />
If but lovelier ideas, with Nature agr&#275;eing,<br />
Are to his understanding offer'd.... But enough: 'tis an unsolv'd<br />
Mystery.&mdash;Yet man dreams to flatter<sup>v</sup>his d&#275;ity saying<br />
'Beautiful is Nature!' rather 'tis various, endless,<br />
And her efforts fertile in error tho' grand in attainment.<br />
If wÃ©, while praising<sup>v</sup>her scheme and infinite order,<br />
Are compell'd to select, our choice condemns the remainder;<br />
Nor can wisdom honour those loathly polluting offences,   <span class="linenum">401</span><br />
Whose very names to the Muse are either accursÃ¨d or unknown.<br />
Nay, if such foul things thou deemest worthy, the fault was<br />
Making us, O Nature, thy judge and tearful accuser.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turn our thought for awhile to the symphonies of Beethoven,</span><br />
Or the rever'd preludes of mighty Sebastian; Is there<br />
One work of Nature's contrivance beautiful as these?<br />
Judg'd by beauty alone man wins, as sensuous artist;<br />
And for other qualities, the spirit's differentia, Nature<br />
Scarce observes them at all: that keen unfaltering insight,   <span class="linenum">410</span><br />
Whereby<sup>v</sup>earthly desire's roaming wildernesses are changed<br />
Into a garden a-bloom; its wandering impossible ways<br />
Into pillar'd avenues, alleys and fair-flow'ry terrac'd walks,<br />
(Where <span class="smcap">God</span> talks with man, as once 'twas fancied of Eden;)<br />
That transcendental supreme interpreting of sense,<a name="page_424" id="page_424"></a><span class="pagenumb">{424}</span><br />
Rendering intelligence passionate with mystery, linking<br />
Sympathy with grandeur, the reserve of dignity with play;<br />
Those soul-formalities, the balance held 'twixt the den&#299;al<br />
And the betrayal of intention, whose masteries invite,<br />
Entice, welcome ever, meet, and with kindliness embrace;   <span class="linenum">420</span><br />
Those guarded floodgates of boundless, lovely resources,<br />
Whence nothing ill issues, no distraction nor abortion<br />
Hindering enjoyment, but in easy security flow forth<br />
Ecstasies of fitness, raptures and harmonies of heav'n.<br />
Surely before such work of man, so kindly attemper'd,<br />
Nature must be asham'd, had sh&#275; not this ready answer,<br />
'Fool, and who made thee?'&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I shall not seem a deserter,</span><br />
Where in an idle essay my verse to a fancy abandon'd<br />
Praiseth others: rather while art and beauty delight us,<br />
While hope, faith and love are warm and lively in our hearts,<br />
Sweet our earthly desire and dear our human affection,   <span class="linenum">431</span><br />
We may, joyfully despising the pedantries of old age,<br />
Hold to the time, nor lose the delight of mortal attainment;<br />
Keenly rejoicing in all that wisdom approves, nor allowing<br />
Ourselves at the challenge of younger craft to be outsailed;<br />
But trimming our old canvas in all change of weather and wind,<br />
Freely without fear urge o'erseas our good vessel onward,<br />
Piloting into the far, unmapp'd futurity.&mdash;Farewell.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 8%;">TO A SOCIALIST IN LONDON</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />

No<sup>v</sup>ethical system, no contemplation or action,<br />
No reason'd attitude of mind nor principle of faith,<br />
Neither S&#333;cratical wisdom nor saintly devotion,<br />
Buildeth a fortress against heart-ache &amp; compassionate grief,<br />
Nor responds to desire, nor with true mastery yieldeth<br />
Easy repose to the mind; And since all our study endeth<br />
Emptily in full doubt,&mdash;fathoming the divine intention<br />
In this one thing alone, that, hows&#333;e'er it affect us,<br />
'Twas never intended for mortal fancy to compass,&mdash;<br />
I<sup>v</sup>have concluded that from first purposes unknown   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
None should seek to deduce id&#275;al laws to be liv'd by;<br />
And, loving art, am true to the Muse, &amp; p&#333;etry extol:<br />
Therefore 'twas that afore I prais'd &amp; heartily enjoy'd<br />
Your human verses, <span class="smcap">Fraser</span>, when nobody bought them,<br />
More than again I praise those serious exhortations,<br />
Wherewith you wu'd amend the degraded people about you.<br />
Nay tho' like a prophet with heav'n-sent dignity inspir'd,<br />
With ready convincement and stern example assuring,<br />
Mightily you proclaim your love-messag' in the assembly,<br />
Exhibiting panac&#275;as of ancient ill, propagating   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Out of a Scotch cerebrum the reforming zeal of a <span class="smcap">Tolstoi</span>,<br />
I listen all unmov'd, as a sceptic among the believers.<br />
Yet what a charm has an earnest soul, whom sympathy uncheckt<br />
For human suffering has strengthen'd and dedicated<br />
Bravely to serve his kind, to renounce his natural instinct,<br />
And liv' apart, indulging in acts of mercy, delighted<br />
In wisdom's rock-hewn citadel<sup>v</sup>her law to illustrate,<br />
Embodying the pattern of self-integrity complete.<a name="page_426" id="page_426"></a><span class="pagenumb">{426}</span><br />
Yea, what a charm pervades discourse, that loftily reason'd<br />
Points the narrow pathway throu' this world's ugly disorder;<br />
How very fair will appear any gate of cleanliness, open   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
From the city's tumult, its rank impurity, its dread<br />
Vulgarity's triumph: Nay sure &amp; bounteous as Truth,<br />
Beautiful in confusion appeareth Simplicity's way.<br />
&mdash;'Simple it is, (yÃ³u say) God is good,&mdash;Nature is ample,&mdash;<br />
'Earth yields plenty for all,&mdash;and all might share in abundance,<br />
'Were profit and labour but fairly divided among them.<br />
'Scarce any laws are needed in our Utopia but these,&mdash;<br />
'No fruitless labour to provide mere useless adornment,<br />

'Of titeld landlords, no pamper'd luxury breeding<br />
'Fleshly disease, worst fiend &amp; foe of mind body and soul;<br />
'All should work, and only produce life's only requirements:<br />
'So with days all halfholidays, toil healthfully enjoy'd,<br />
'Each might, throu' leisure hours of amusement p&#299;ety and peace,<br />
'In the domestic joys &amp; holy community partake.&mdash;'<br />

Will by subdivision disappear in course of atainment.<br />
When goods are<sup>v</sup>increas'd, mouths are<sup>v</sup>increas'd to devour them:<br />
If the famine be reliev'd this season in India, next dearth<br />
Will be a worse. Yo&#363; know how one day Herschel acosted<br />
SÃºch a philanthropical Save-all, who claimed to acomplish<br />
Some greatest happiness for a greatest number; 'Attend, man;<br />
(SaÃ­d-he) ResÃ³lve me anon one query: Suppose Adam and Eve<br />

That they gat four children in all, who liv'd, getting also<br />
Four to the pair: Had thus mankind ever equaly increast   <span class="linenum">60</span><br />
By moderate families but doubling in each generation,<br />
How many souls would now be alive to revise the conundrum<br />
Of greatest happiness? No<sup>v</sup>answer? Well, 'tis a long sum.<br />
Say if on earth such a crowd could stand. No? Pray then imÃ¡gine<br />
All earth's land as a plain, &amp; all this company thereon,<br />
Piled together like peas in a pintpot: How many layers?<br />
No guess? Then how high the column? How far wu'd it extend<br />
Into the sky?&mdash;To the moon?&mdash;Further&mdash;To the sun?&mdash;To the sun! Pshaw!<br />
That column of happy men would reach up, as I fathom its height,<br />
Million d&#299;ameters of Neptune's infinit' orbit.'   <span class="linenum">70</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My<sup>v</sup>objection annoys your kindly philanthropy?&mdash;'It proves</span><br />
'Too much.'&mdash;Yes nature shows in that scrutiny bankrupt;<br />
Mere matter in deposit gives out. YÃ³u wish to determine<br />
No limit of future polities: your actual object<br />

For public mischief, who might, if usefully harness'd<br />
In common employment, have assisted social order.<br />

It pusheth out &amp; thrusteth away pitilessly the weak ones,<br />
Those ill-fated, opprest, unfortun'd needy: Beneath them<br />
Yawns the abyss. Down down they fall, as a stream on a mountain,<br />
With ceaseless cataract. None hearkeneth; only the silent<br />
Grave, that darkly devours their cry of desperate anguish.<br />

Nay dream not so quickly to see her ladyship expell'd.<br />

Wandering in the Somali desert or waste Kalahari,<br />

Stalked as a deer, surprised where h&#275; lay slumbering at noon<br />
Under a rock full-gorged, or deep in reedy covert hid   <span class="linenum">160</span><br />

They that<sup>v</sup>have these things in plenty desire to retain them,<br />

Nay and since possession will leave the desire unappeasÃ¨d,<br />

On their mental image, than on experienc'd operation.<br />

All that time to be rattling alÃ³ng on a furious engine<br />
In caoutchouc carapace, with a trail of damnable oilstench.<br />
Yea, blame not the pleasures; they are not enough; pleasure only<br />
Makes this life liveable: nor scout that doctrine as unsound:<br />
Consider if mankind from puling birth to bitter death<br />
Knew nought but the sorrows, endured unrespited always<br />
Those agonizing assaults which no flesh wholly can escape;<br />

Did love burn his soul as fire his skin; did affections   <span class="linenum">300</span><br />

Were his labour a breathless effort; his slumber occasion<br />
For visiting Furies to repair his temple of anguish;<br />
Were thoughts all mockeries; slow intelligence a deception;<br />
His mind's far ventures, her voyages into the unseen<br />
But horror &amp; terrified nightmare; None then had ever heard<br />
Praise of a Cr&#275;ator, nor seen any D&#275;ity worshipped.<br />
'Twas for heav'nly Pleasure that God did first fashion all thing,<a name="page_435" id="page_435"></a><span class="pagenumb">{435}</span><br />

Where Saint Luke,&mdash;colouring (was it unconsciously, suppose you?)<br />
Fact and fable alike,&mdash;contrasts a beggar with a rich man,<br />
And from holding a fool's happiness too greatly in esteem<br />
Makes pleasure &#275;ternal the balance of temporal evil,<br />
And the reverse; nor shrinks, ascribing thus to the next world<br />
Vaster inequalities, harsher perversity than this.<br />

Whose images from of old have haunted P&#333;etry, settling<br />
On the blossoms of man's dream-garden, as on the summer-flow'rs,<br />
Pictures of happy toil, sunny glances, gendering always<br />
Such sweet thoughts, as be by slumbrous music awaken'd?<br />
How all their outward happiness,&mdash;that fairy demeanour<br />
Of busy contentment, singing at their work,&mdash;is an inborn   <span class="linenum">360</span><br />
Empty habit, the relics of a time when considerate joy<br />
Truly possest their tiny bodies; when golden abundance<br />
Was not a State-kept hoard; when feasts were plentiful indulg'd<br />
With wine well-fermented, or old-stored spicy metheglin:<br />
For they died not then miserably within the second moon<br />
Forgotten, unrespected of all; but slept many winters,<br />
Saw many springs, liv'd, lov'd like men, consciously rejoicing<br />
In Nature's promises, with like hopes and recollections.<br />
Intelligence had brought them Sc&#299;ence, Genius enter'd;<br />
Seers and sages arose, great Bees, perfecting among them   <span class="linenum">370</span><br />
Copious inventions, with man's art worthily compared.<br />
Then was a time when that, which haps not in ages of ages,<br />
Strangely befel: they stole from Nature's secresy one key,<a name="page_437" id="page_437"></a><span class="pagenumb">{437}</span><br />
Found the hidden motive which works to var&#299;ety of kind;<br />
And thus came wondrously possest of pow'r to determine<br />
Their children's qualities, habitudes, yea their specialized form<br />
Masculine or feminine to produce, or asexual offspring<br />
Redow'rd and differenced with such alternative organs<br />
As they chose, to whate'er preferential function adapted,<br />
Wax-pocket or honey-bag, with an instinct rightly acordant.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We know well the result, but not what causes effected <span class="linenum">381</span></span><br />
Their decision to prefer so blindly the race to the unit,<br />
As to renounce happiness for a problem, a vain abstraction;<br />
Making home and kingdom a vast egg-factory, wherein<br />
Food and life are stor'd up alike, and strictly proportion'd<br />
In loveless labour with mean anx&#299;ety. Wondrous<br />
Their reason'd motive, their altr&#363;istic obedience<br />
Unto a self-impos'd life-sentence of prison or toil.<br />
Wonder wisely! then ask if these ingenious insects,<br />
(Who made Natur' against her will their activ' acomplice,<br />
And, methodizing anew her heartless system, averted   <span class="linenum">391</span><br />
From their house the torrent of whelming natural increase,)<br />
Are blood-guiltless among their own-born prÃ³geny: What skill<br />
Keeps their peace, or what price buys it? Alack! 'tis murder,<br />
Murder again. No worst Oriental despot, assuring<br />
'Gainst birthright or faction or envy his ill-gotten empire,<br />
So decimates his kin, as do these rown-bodied egg-queens<br />
Surprise competitors, and stab their slumbering infants,<br />
Into the wax-cradles replunging their double-edged stings.<br />
Or what a deed of blood some high-day, when the summer<sup>v</sup>hath   <span class="linenum">400</span><br />
Their clammy cells o'erbrim'd, and already ripening orchards<br />
And late flow'rs proclaim that starving winter approacheth,<br />
Nor will again any queen lead forth her swarm, dispeopling<br />
Their strawbuilt citadel; then watch how these busy workers<br />
Cease for awhile from toil; how crowding upon the devoted<a name="page_438" id="page_438"></a><span class="pagenumb">{438}</span><br />
Drones they fall; those easy fellows gave some provocation;<br />
Yet 'tis a foul massacre, cold murder of unsuspecting<br />
Life-long companions; and done bloodthirstily:&mdash;is not<br />
Exercise of pow'r a delight? have yÃ³u not a doctrine<br />
That calls duty pleasure? What an if they make merry, saying<br />
'Lazy-livers, runagates, evil beasts, greedy devourers,   <span class="linenum">411</span><br />
'Too happy and too long ye've liv'd, unashamed to have outliv'd<br />
'Your breeders, feeders, warmers and toiling attendants;<br />
'Had-ye ever been worthy a public good to accomplish,<br />
'Each had nobly perish'd long-ago. Unneeded, obese ones,<br />
'Impious encumbrance, whose hope of service is over,<br />
'Who did not, now can not, assist the community, <span class="smcap">Ye die</span>!'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My parable may serve. What wisdom man hath attain'd to</span><br />
Came to him of Nature's goodwill throu' tardy selection:<br />
Should her teaching accuse herself and her method impugn,<br />
I may share with her the reproach of approving as artist   <span class="linenum">421</span><br />
Far other id&#275;als than what seem needful in action.<br />
This difficulty besets our time. If you have an answer,<br />
Write me it, as you keep your salt in savour; or if toil<br />
Grant you an indulgence, here lies fair country, direct then<br />
Your Sabbath excursion westward, and spend a summer-day<br />
Preaching among the lilies what you<sup>v</sup>have preached to the chimneys.<br />&nbsp;<br />

Full thirty moons since unwilling enmity,<br />
Since daily suspense for hideous peril<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of brethren unrescued, beleaguer'd</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Plague-stricken in cities unprovided,</span><br />

Had quencht accustom'd gaiety, from the day<br />
When first the Dutchman's implacable folly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The country of Shakspeare def&#772;ing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Thought with a curse to appal the nation:</span><br />

Anger'd awhile our easy democracy;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That, reckless and patient of insult,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Will not abide arrogant def&#299;ance:</span><br />

They called to arms; and war began evilly.<br />
From slily forestor'd, well-hidden armouries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And early advantage, the despot</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Stood for a time prevalent against us:</span><br />

Till from the coil of slow-gathering battle<br />
He rancorous, with full moneybags hurried,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ev'n to celestial excellencies;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 13%;"><i>Scazons</i></span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />

Since I believe in God the Father Almighty,<br />
Man's Maker and Judge, Overruler of Fortune,<br />
'Twere strange should I praise anything and refuse Him praise,<br />
Should love the creature forgetting the Cr&#275;ator,<br />
Nor unto Him<sup>v</sup>in suff'ring and sorrow turn me:<br />
Nay how coud I withdraw me from<sup>v</sup>His embracing?<br />
<br />
But since that I have seen not, and cannot know Him,<br />
Nor in my earthly temple apprehend rightly<br />
His wisdom and the heav'nly purpose &#275;ternal;<br />
Therefore will I be bound to no studied system<br />
Nor argument, nor with delusion enslave me,<br />
Nor seek to plÃ©ase Him in any foolish invention,<br />
Which my spirit within me, that loveth beauty<br />
And hateth evil, hath reprov'd as unworthy:<br />
<br />
But I cherish my freedom in loving service,<br />
Gratefully adoring for delight beyond asking<br />
Or thinking, and in hours of anguish and darkness<br />
Confiding always on<sup>v</sup>His excellent greatness.<br />&nbsp;<br />

Have the avenging Cares laid their sleepless habitation,<br />
Wailing Grief, pallid Infections, &amp; heart-stricken Old-age,<br />
Dismal Fear, unholy Famine, with low-groveling Want,<br />
Forms of spectral horror, gaunt Toil and Death the devourer,<br />

Raged, and mad Discord high brandisht her venomous locks.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Midway of all this tract, with secular arms an immense elm</span><br />
Reareth a crowd of branches, aneath whose leafy protection<br />
Vain dreams thickly nestle, clinging unto the foliage on high:<br />
And many strange creatures of monstrous form and features<br />
Stable about th' entrance, Centaur and Scylla's abortion,<br />
And hundred-handed Briareus, and Lerna the wildbeast<br />
Roaring amain, and clothed in frightful flame the ChimÃ¦ra,<br />
Gorgons and Harpies, ' and Pluto's three-bodied ogre.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In terror Ã†neas upheld his sword to defend him, <span class="linenum">290</span></span><br />
With ready naked point confronting their dreaded onset:<br />
And had not the Sibyl warn'd how these lively spirits were<br />
All incorporeal, flitting in thin maskery of form,<br />
He had assail'd their host, and wounded vainly the void air.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hence is a road that led them a-down to the Tartarean streams,</span><br />
Where Acheron's whirlpool impetuous, into the reeky<br />
Deep of Cokytos disgorgeth, with muddy burden.<br />
These floods one ferryman serveth, most awful of aspect,<br />
Of squalor infernal, Ch&#257;ron: all filthily unkempt<br />

And the relics of mÃ©n in his ash-grey barge ferries over;<br />
Already old, but green to a god and hearty will age be.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now hitherward to the bank much folk were crowding, a medley</span><br />
Of men and matrons; nor did death's injury conceal<br />
Bravespirited heroes, young maidens beauteous unwed,<br />
And boys borne to the grave in sight of their sorrowing sires.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Countless as in the forest, at a first white frosting of autumn</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ã†neas in wonder alike and deep pity then spake.</span><br />
'Tell-me,' said he, 'my guide, why flock these crowds to the water?<br />

Doom'd for a term, which term expired they win to deliv'rance.'   <span class="linenum">330</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he that harken'd stood agaze, his journey arrested,</span><br />
Grieving at heart and much pitying their unmerited lot.<br />
There miserably fellow'd in death's indignity saw he<br />
Leucaspis with his old Lycian seachieften Orontes,<br />
Whom together from Troy in home-coming over the waters<br />
Wild weather o'ermaster'd, engulphing both shipping and men.<br />
And lo! his helmsman, Palinurus, in eager emotion,<br />
Who on th' Afric course, in bright star-light, with a fair wind,<br />
Fell by slumber opprest unheedfully into the wide sea:<br />
Whom i' the gloom when hardly he knew, now changed in affliction,   <span class="linenum">340</span><br />
<a name="page_451" id="page_451"></a><span class="pagenumb">{451}</span>First he addrest. 'What God, tell-me O Palinurus, of all gods<br />
PlÃºckt you away and drown'd i' the swift wake-water abandon'd?<br />
For never erst nor in else hath kind responsive Apollo<br />
Led-me astray, but alone in this thing wholly deluded,<br />
When he aver'd that you, to remote Aus&#333;nia steering,<br />
Safe would arrive. Where now his truth? Is this the promis'd faith?'<br />
But he, 'Neither again did Ph&oelig;bus wrongly bespeak thee,<br />

For the tiller, wherewith I led thy fleet's navigation,<br />
And still clung to, was in my struggling hold of it unshipt,   <span class="linenum">350</span><br />
And came with-me' o'erboard. Ah! then, by ev'ry accurst sea,<br />
Tho' in utter despair, far less mine own peril awed me<br />
Than my thought o' the ship, what harm might hÃ¡p to her, yawing<br />
In the billows helmless, with a high wind and threatening gale.<br />
Two nights and one day buffeted held I to the good spar<br />
Windborne, with the current far-drifting, an' on the second morn<br />
Saw, when a great wave raised me aloft, the Italyan highlands;<br />
And swimming-on with effort got ashore, nay already was saved,<br />
Had not there the wrecking savages, who spied-me defenceless,<br />
Scarce clinging outwearied to a rock, half-drowned &amp; speechless,   <span class="linenum">360</span><br />
BeÃ¡t me to death for hope of an unfound booty upon me.<br />
Now to the wind and tidewash a sport my poor body rolleth.<br />
Wherefore thee, by heav'n's sweet light &amp; airness, I pray,<br />
By thy Sire's memories, thy hope of youthful Iulus,<br />
Rescue-me from these ills, brave master; Go to Velija,<br />
O'er my mortality's spoil cast thou th' all-hallowing dust;<a name="page_452" id="page_452"></a><span class="pagenumb">{452}</span><br />
Or better, if so be the goddess, heav'n's lady-Creatress,<br />
Show-thee the way,&mdash;nor surely without high favoring impulse<br />
Mak'st thou ventur' across these floods &amp; black Ereban lake,&mdash;<br />
Give thy hand-to-me', an' o'er their watery boundary bring me   <span class="linenum">370</span><br />
Unto the haven of all, death's home of quiet abiding.'<br />
Thus-he lamented, anon spake sternly the maid of Avernus.<br />
'Whence can such unruly desire, Palinurus, assail thee?<br />
Wilt thou th' Eumenidan waters visit unburied? o'erpass<br />
Hell's Stygian barrier? Ch&#257;ron's boat unbidden enter?<br />
Cease to believe that fate can bÃ© by prayÃ«r averted.<br />

Surely the people of all thy new-found country, determin'd<br />

Build thee a tomb of honour with yearly solemnity ordain'd,<br />
And dedicate for ever thy storied name to the headland.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These words lighten awhile his fear, his sadness allaying,</span><br />
Nor vain was the promise his name should eternally survive.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They forthwith their journey renew, tending to the water:</span><br />
Whom when th' old boatman descried silently emerging<br />
Out o' the leafy shadows, advancing t'ward the river-shore,<br />
Angrily gave-he challenge, imperious in salutation.<br />
'Whosoever thou be, that approachest my river all-arm'd,<br />
Stand to announce thyself, nor further make footing onward.<br />
Here 'tis a place of ghosts, of night &amp; drowsy delusion:   <span class="linenum">390</span><br />
Forbidden unto living mortals is my Stygian keel:<br />
Truly not Alkides embarkt I cheerfully, nor took<br />
Of Theseus or Pirithous glad custody, nay though<br />
God-sprung were they both, warriors invincible in might:<br />
HÃ© 'twas would sportively the guard of Tartarus enchain,<br />
Yea and from the palace with gay contumely dragged him:<br />
ThÃ©y to ravish Hell's Queen from Pluto's chamber attempted.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then thus th' Amphrysian prophetess spake briefly in answer.</span><br />
'No such doughty designs are ours, Cease thou to be movÃ¨d!<br />

'Thou mayst know.' Forthwith his bluster of heart was appeasÃ¨d:<br />

And the spirits, that along the gun'al benchways sat in order,<br />
Drave he ashore, offering readyroom: but when the vessel took<br />
Ponderous Ã†neas, her timbers crankily straining<br />
Creak'd, an' a brown water came trickling through the upper seams.<br />
Natheless both Sibyl Ã¡nd Hero, slow wafted across stream,<br />
Safe on th' ooze &amp; slime's hideous desolation alighted.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hence the triple-throated bellowings of Cerberus invade</span><br />
All Hell, where opposite the arrival he lies in a vast den.<br />
But the Sibyl, who mark'd his necklaces of stiffening snakes,<br />
Cast him a cake, poppy-drench'd with drowsiness and honey-sweeten'd.   <span class="linenum">420</span><br />
He, rabid and distending a-hungry' his triply-cavern'd jaws,<br />
Gulp'd the proffer'd morsel; when slow he-relaxt his immense bulk,<br />
And helplessly diffused fell out-sprawl'd over the whole cave.<br />
Ã†neas fled by, and left full boldly the streamway,<br />
That biddeth all men across but alloweth ne'er a returning.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Already now i' the air were voices heard, lamentation,</span><br />

Me the command of a god, who here my journey determines<br />
Through Ereban darkness, through fields sown with desolation,<a name="page_455" id="page_455"></a><span class="pagenumb">{455}</span><br />
Drave-me to wrong my heart. Nay tho' deep-pain'd to desert thee<br />
I ne'er thought to provoke thy pain of mourning eternal.<br />
Stay yet awhile, ev'n here unlook'd-for again look upon me:<br />
Fly-me not ere the supreme words that Fate granteth us are said.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus he: but the spirit was raging, fiercely defiant,</span><br />
Whom he approach'd with words to appease, with tears for atonement.<br />
She to the ground downcast her &nbsp;'&nbsp; eyes in fixity averted;<br />
Nor were her features more by his pleading affected,   <span class="linenum">470</span><br />
Than wer' a face of flint, or of ensculptur'd alabaster.<br />
At length she started disdainful, an' angrily withdrew<br />
Into a shady thicket: where her grief kindly SychÃ¦us<br />
Sooth'd with other memories, first love and virginal embrace.<br />
And ever Ã†neas, to remorse by deep pity soften'd,<br />
With brimming eyes pursued her queenly figure disappearing.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thence the Sibyl to the plain's extremest boundary led him,</span><br />
Where world-fam'd warriors, a lionlike company, haunted.<br />
Here great Tydeus saw he eclips'd, &amp; here the benighted<br />
Phantom of Adrastus, &nbsp;'&nbsp; of stalwart ParthenopÃ¦us.   <span class="linenum">480</span><br />
Here long mourn'd upon earth went all that prowess of Ilium<br />
Fallen in arms; whom, when he-beheld them, so many and great,<br />
Much he-bewail'd. By Thersilochus his mighty brothers stood,<br />
Children of Antenor; here Demetria<span class="midletter">^</span>n Polyphates,<br />
And IdÃ¦us, in old chariot-pose dreamily stalking.<br />
Right and left the spirits flocking on stood crowding around him;<br />
Nor their eyes have enough; they touch, find joy unwonted<br />
Marching in equal stÃ©p, and eager of his coming enquire.<br />
But th' Argive leaders, and they that obey'd Agamemnon<br />
When they saw that Trojan in arms come striding among them,   <span class="linenum">490</span><br />
Old terror invaded their ranks: some fled stricken, as once<a name="page_456" id="page_456"></a><span class="pagenumb">{456}</span><br />
They to the ships had fled for shelter; others the alarm raise,<br />
But their thin utterance mock'd vainly the lips wide parted.<br />
Here too Deiphobus he espied, his fair body mangled,<br />
Cruelly dismember'd, disfeatur'd cruelly his face,<br />
Face and hands; and lo! shorn closely from either temple,<br />
Gone wer' his ears, and maim'd each nostril in impious outrage.<br />
Barely he-knew him again cow'ring shamefastly' an' hiding<br />
His dire plight, &amp; thus he 'his old companyon accosted.<br />
'Noblest Deiphobus, great Teucer's intrepid offspring,   <span class="linenum">500</span><br />
Who was it, inhuman, coveted so cruel a vengeance?<br />
Who can hav' adventur'd on thÃ©e? That last terrible night<br />
Thou wert said to hav' exceeded thy bravery, an' only<br />
On thy faln enemies wert faln by weariness o'ercome.<br />
Wherefor' upon the belov'd sea-shore thine empty sepulchral<br />
Mound I erected, aloud on thy ghost tearfully calling.<br />
Name and shield keep for-thee the place; but thy body, dear friend,<br />
Found I not, to commit to the land ere sadly' I left it.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then the son of Priam ' 'I thought not, friend, to reproach thee:</span><br />
Thou didst all to the full, ev'n my shade's service, accomplish.     <span class="linenum">510</span><br />
'Twas that uninterdicted adultress from LacedÃ¦mon<br />
Drave-me to doom, &amp; planted in hell, her trophy triumphant.<br />
On that night,&mdash;how vain a security and merrymaking<br />
Then sullied us thou know'st, yea must too keenly remember,&mdash;<br />
When the ill-omened horse o'erleapt Troy's lofty defences,<br />
Dragg'd in amidst our town pregnant with a burden of arm'd men.<br />
She then, her Phrygian women in feign'd phrenzy collecting,<br />
All with torches aflame, in wild Bacchic orgy paraded,<br />
Flaring a signal aloft to her ambusht confederate Greeks.<br />
I from a world of care had fled with weariful eyelids   <span class="linenum">520</span><br />
Unto my unhappy chamber', an' lay fast lockt in oblivyon,<a name="page_457" id="page_457"></a><span class="pagenumb">{457}</span><br />
Sunk to the depth of rest as a child that nought will awaken.<br />
Meanwhile that paragon helpmate had robb'd me of all arms,<br />
E'en from aneath the pillow my blade of trust purloining;&mdash;<br />
Then to the gate; wide flÃ­ngs she it op'n an' calls Menelaus.<br />
Would not a so great service attach her faithful adorer?<br />
Might not it extinguish the repute of her earlier illdeeds?<br />
Brief-be the tale. Menelaus arrives: in company there came<br />
His crime-counsellor Ã†olides. So, and more also<br />
DÃ©al-ye', O Gods, to the Greeks! an' if I call justly upon you.&mdash;   <span class="linenum">530</span><br />
But thou; what fortune hitherward, in turn prithy tell me,<br />
Sent-thee alive, whether erring upon the bewildering Ocean,<br />
Or high-prompted of heav'n, or by Fate wearily hunted,<br />
That to the sunless abodes and dusky demesnes thou approachest?'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ev'n as awhile they thus converse it is already mid-day</span><br />
Unperceiv'd, but aloft earth's star had turn'd to declining.<br />
And haply' Ã†neas his time in parley had outgone,<br />
Had not then the Sibyl with word of warning avized him.<br />
'Night hieth, Ã†neas; in tears our journey delayeth.<br />
See our road, that it here in twain disparteth asunder;   <span class="linenum">540</span><br />
This to the right, skirting by th' high city-fortresses of Dis,<br />
Endeth in Elysium, our path; but that to the leftward<br />
Only receives their feet who wend to eternal affliction.'<br />
Deiphobus then again, 'Speak not, great priestess, in anger;<br />
I will away to refill my number among th' unfortun'd.<br />
Thou, my champyon, adieu! Go where thy glory awaits thee!'<br />
When these words he 'had spok'n, he-turn'd and hastily was fled.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ã†neas then look'd where leftward, under a mountain,</span><br />
Outspread a wide city lay, threefold with fortresses engirt,<br />
Lickt by a Tartarean river of live fire, the torrentia<span class="midletter">^</span>l   <span class="linenum">550</span><br />
Red Phlegethon, and huge boulders his roundy bubbles be:<br />
Right i' the front stareth the columnar gate adamantine,<br />
Such that no battering warfare of mÃ©n or immortals<a name="page_458" id="page_458"></a><span class="pagenumb">{458}</span><br />
E'er might shake; blank-faced to the cloud its bastion upstands.<br />
Tisiphone thereby in a bloodspotty robe sitteth alway<br />
Night and day guarding sleeplessly the desperat entrance,<br />
Wherefrom an awestirring groan-cry and fierce clamour outburst,<br />
Sharp lashes, insane yells, dragg'd chains and clanking of iron.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ã†neas drew back, his heart by' his hearing affrighted:</span><br />
'What manner of criminals, my guide, now tell-me,' he-question'd,   <span class="linenum">560</span><br />
'Or what their penalties? what this great wail that ariseth?'<br />
Answering him the divine priestess, 'Brave hero of Il[Ã®Ã»]m,<br />
O'er that guilty threshold no breath of purity may come:<br />
But Hecate, who gave-me to rule i' the groves of Avernus,<br />
Herself led me around, &amp; taught heav'n's high retribution.<br />
Here Cretan Rhadamanthus in unblest empery reigneth,<br />
Secret crime to punish,&mdash;full surely he-wringeth avowal<br />
Even of all that on earth, by vain impunity harden'd,<br />
Men sinning have put away from thought till<sup>v</sup>impenitent death.<br />
On those convicted tremblers then leapeth avenging   <span class="linenum">570</span><br />
Tisiphone with keen flesh-whips and vipery scourges,<br />
And of her implacable sisters inviteth attendance.'<br />
&mdash;Now sudden on screeching hinges that portal accursÃ¨d<br />
Flung wide its barriers.&mdash;'In what dire custody, mark thou,<br />
Is the threshold! guarded by how grim sentry the doorway!<br />
More terrible than they the ravin'd insatiable Hydra<br />
That sitteth angry within. Know too that Tartarus itself<br />
Dives sheer gaping aneath in gloomy profundity downward<br />
Twice that height that a man looketh-up t'ward airy Olympus.<br />
Lowest there those children of Earth, Titanian elders,   <span class="linenum">580</span><br />
In the abyss, where once they fell hurl'd, yet wallowing lie.<br />
There the AlÃ¶&#299;dÃ¦ saw I, th' ungainly rebel twins<br />
PrimÃ¦val, that assay'd to devastate th' EmpyrÃ¦an<a name="page_459" id="page_459"></a><span class="pagenumb">{459}</span><br />
With huge hands, and rob from Jove his kingdom immortal.<br />
And there Salmoneus I saw, rend'ring heavy payment,<br />
For that he idly' had mockt heav'n's fire and thunder electric;<br />
With chariot many-yoked and torches brandishing on high<br />
Driving among 'his Graian folk in Olympian Elis;<br />
Exultant as a God he rode in blasphemy worshipt.   <span class="linenum">589</span><br />
Fool, who th' unreckoning tempest and deadly dreaded bolt<br />
Thought to mimic with brass and confus'd trample of horses!<br />
But 'him th' Omnipotent, from amidst his cloudy pavilyon,<br />
Blasted, an' eke his rattling car and smoky pretences<br />
Extinguish'd at a stroke, scattering &nbsp;'&nbsp; his dust to the whirlwind.<br />
There too huge Tityos, whom Earth that gendereth all things<br />
Once foster'd, spreadeth-out o'er nine full roods his immense limbs.<br />
On him a wild vulture with hook-beak greedily gorgeth<br />
His liver upsprouting quick as that Hell-chicken eateth.<br />
ShÃ© diggeth and dwelleth under the vast ribs, her bloody bare neck<br />
Lifting anon: ne'er loathes-she the food, ne'er fails the renewal.   <span class="linenum">600</span><br />
Where wer' an end their names to relate, their crimes and torments?<br />
Some o'er whom a hanging black rock, slipping at very point of<br />
Falling, ever threateneth: Couches luxurious invite<br />
Softly-cushion'd to repose: Tables for banqueting outlaid<br />
Tempt them ever-famishing: hard by them a Fury regardeth,<br />
And should thÃ©y but a hand uplift, trembling to the dainties,<br />
She with live firebrand and direful yell springeth on them.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their crimes,&mdash;not to' hav lov'd a brother while love was allow'd them;</span><br />
Or to' hav struck their father, or inveigled a dependant;   <span class="linenum">609</span><br />
Or who chancing alone on wealth prey'd lustfully thereon,<br />
Nor made share with others, no greater company than they:<a name="page_460" id="page_460"></a><span class="pagenumb">{460}</span><br />
Some for adultery slain; some their bright swords had offended<br />
Drawn i' the wrong: or a master's trust with perfidy had met:<br />
Dungeon'd their penalties they await. Look not to be answer'd<br />
What that doom, nor th' end of these men think to determine.<br />
SÃ³me aye roll heavy rocks, some whirl dizzy on the revolving<br />
Spokes of a pendant wheel: sitteth and to eternity shall sit<br />
Unfortun'd Theseus; while sad Phlegias saddeneth hell<br />
With vain oyez to' all loud crying a tardy repentance,<br />
"Walk, O man, i' the fear of GÃ³d, and learn to be righteous!"<br />
Here another, who sold for gold his country, promoting   <span class="linenum">621</span><br />
Her tyrant; or annull'd for a base bribe th' inviolate law.<br />
This one had unfather'd his blood with bestial incest:<br />
All some fearful crime had dared &amp; vaunted achievement.<br />
What mind could harbour the offence of such recollection,<br />
Or lend welcoming ear to the tale of iniquity and shame,<br />
And to the pains wherewith such deeds are justly requited?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ev'n when thus she' had spok'n, the priestess dear to Apollo,</span><br />
'But, ready, come let us Ã³n, perform-we the order appointed!<br />
Hast'n-we (saith-she), the wall forged on Cyclopian anvils<br />
Now I see, an' th' archway in Ã†tna's furnace attemper'd,   <span class="linenum">631</span><br />
Where my lore biddeth us to depose our high-privileg'd gift.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then together they trace i' the drooping dimness a footpath,</span><br />
Whereby, faring across, they arrive at th' arches of iron.<br />
Ã†neas stept into the porch, and duly besprinkling<br />
His body with clear water affixt his bough to the lintel;<br />
And, having all perform'd at length with ritual exact,<br />
They came out on a lovely pleasance, that dream'd-of oasis,<br />
Fortunate isle, the abode o' the blest, their fair Happy Woodland.<br />
Here is an ampler sky, those meads ar' azur'd by a gentler<a name="page_461" id="page_461"></a><span class="pagenumb">{461}</span><br />
Sun than th' Earth, an' a new starworld their darkness adorneth.   <span class="linenum">641</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some were matching afoot their speed on a grassy arena,</span><br />
In playful combat some wrestling upon the yellow sand,<br />
Part in a dance-rhythm or poetry's fine phantasy engage;<br />
While full-toga'd anear their high-priest musical Orpheus<br />
Bade his prime sev'n tones in varied harmony discourse,<br />
Now with finger, anon sounding with an ivory plectrum.<br />
And here Ã†neas met Teucer's fortunate offspring,<br />
High-spirited heroes, fair-favor'd sons o' the morning,<br />
Assarac and Ilos &nbsp;'&nbsp; and Dardan founder of Iliu<span class="midletter">^</span>]m:   <span class="linenum">650</span><br />
Their radiant chariots he' espied rank't empty afar off,<br />
Their spears planted afield, their horses wandering at large,<br />
Grazing around:&mdash;as on earth their joy had been, whether armour<br />
Or chariot had charmed them, or if 'twer' good manage and care<br />
Of the gallant warhorse, the delight liv'd here unabated;<br />
Lo! then others, that about the meadow sat feasting in idless,<br />
And chanting for joy a familyar pÃ¦an of old earth,<br />
By fragrant laurel o'ercanopied, where 'twixt enamel'd banks<br />
Bountiful Eridanus glides throu' their bosky retirement.<br />
Here were men who bled for honour, their country defending;   <span class="linenum">660</span><br />
Priests, whose lives wer' a flame of chastity on God's altar;<br />
Holy poets, content to await their crown of Apollo;<br />
Discoverers, whose labour had aided life or ennobled;<br />
Or who fair memories had left though kindly deserving.<br />
On their brow a fillet pearl-white distinguisheth all these:<br />
Whom the Sibyl, for they drew round, in question accosted,<br />
And most MusÃ¦us, who tower'd noble among them,<br />
Center of all that sea of bright faces looking upward.<br />
'Tell, happy souls, and thou poet and high mystic illustrious,<br />
Where dwelleth Anchises? what home hath he? for 'tis in his quest     <span class="linenum">670</span><a name="page_462" id="page_462"></a><span class="pagenumb">{462}</span><br />
We hither have made journey across Hell's watery marches.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">ThertÃ³ with brief parley rejoin'd that mystic of old-time.</span><br />
'In no certain abode we-remain: by turn the forest glade<br />
Haunt-we, lilied stream-bank, sunny mead; and o'er valley and rock<br />
At will rove-we: but if ye aright your purpose arede me,<br />
Mount-ye the hill: myself will prove how easy the pathway.'<br />
Speaking he lÃ©d: and come to the upland, sheweth a fair plain<br />
Gleaming aneath; and they, with grateful adieu, the descent made.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now Lord Anchises was down i' the green valley musing,</span><br />
Where the spirits confin'd that await mortal resurrection   <span class="linenum">680</span><br />
While diligently he-mark'd, his thought had turn'd to his own kin,<br />
Whose numbers he-reckon'd, an' of all their progeny foretold<br />
Their fate and fortune, their ripen'd temper an' action.<br />
He then, when he' espied Ã†neas t'ward him approaching<br />
O'er the meadow, both hands uprais'd and ran to receive him,<br />
Tears in his eyes, while thus his voice in high passion outbrake.<br />
'Ah, thou'rt come, thou'rt come! at length thy dearly belov'd grace<br />
Conquering all hath won-thee the way. 'Tis allow'd to behold thee,<br />
O my son,&mdash;yea again the familyar raptur' of our speech.<br />
Nay, I look't for 't thus, counting patiently the moments,   <span class="linenum">690</span><br />
And ever expected; nor did fond fancy betray me.<br />
From what lands, my son, from what life-dangering ocean<br />
Art-thou arrived? full mighty perils thy path hav' opposÃ¨d:<br />
And how nearly the dark Libyan thy destiny o'erthrew!'<br />
Then 'he, 'Thy spirit, O my sire, 'twas thy spirit often<br />
Sadly appearing aroused-me to seek thy fair habitation.<br />
My fleet moors i' the blue Tyrrhene: all with-me goeth well.<br />
Grant-me to touch thy hand as of old, and thy body embrace.'<br />
Speaking, awhile in tears his feeling mutinied, and when<br />
For the longing contact of mortal affection, he out-held     <span class="linenum">700</span><a name="page_463" id="page_463"></a><span class="pagenumb">{463}</span><br />
His strong arms, the figure sustain'd them not: 'twas as empty<br />
E'en as a windworn cloud, or a phantom of irrelevant sleep.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the level bosom of this vale more thickly the tall trees</span><br />
Grow, an' aneath quivering poplars and whispering alders<br />
Lethe's dreamy river throu' peaceful scenery windeth.<br />
Whereby now flitted in vast swarms many people of all lands,<br />
As when in early summer 'honey-bees on a flowery pasture<br />
Pill the blossoms, hurrying to' an' fro,&mdash;innumerous are they,<br />
Revisiting the ravish'd lily cups, while all the meadow hums.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ã†neas was turn'd to the sight, and marvelling inquired, <span class="linenum">710</span></span><br />
'Say, sir, what the river that there i' the vale-bottom I see?<br />
And who they that thickly along its bank have assembled?'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Lord Anchises, 'The spirits for whom a second life</span><br />
And body are destined ar' arriving thirsty to Lethe,<br />
And here drink th' unmindful draught from wells of oblivyon.<br />
My heart greatly desired of this very thing to acquaint thee,<br />
Yea, and show-thee the men to-be-born, our glory her'after,<br />
So to gladden thine heart where now thy voyaging endeth.'<br />
'Must it then be-believ'd, my sire, that a soul which attaineth<br />
Elysium will again submit to her old body-burden?   <span class="linenum">720</span><br />
Is this well? what hap can awake such dire longing in them?'<br />
'I will tell thee', O son, nor keep thy wonder awaiting,'<br />
Answereth Anchises, and all expoundeth in order.<br />
Know first that the heavens, and th' Earth, and space fluid or void,<br />
Night's pallid orb, day's Sun, and all his starry coÃ¦vals,<br />
Are by one spirit inly quickened, and, mingling in each part,<br />
Mind informs the matter, nature's complexity ruling.<br />
Thence the living creatures, man, brute, and ev'ry feather'd fowl,<br />
And what breedeth in Ocean aneath her surface of argent:<br />
Their seed knoweth a fiery vigour, 'tis of airy divine birth,   <span class="linenum">730</span><br />
In so far as unimpeded by an alien evil,<br />
Nor dull'd by the body's framework condemn'd to corruption.<br />
Hence the desires and vain tremblings that assail them, unable<a name="page_464" id="page_464"></a><span class="pagenumb">{464}</span><br />
Darkly prison'd to arise to celestial exaltation;<br />
Nor when death summoneth them anon earth-life to relinquish,<br />
Can they in all discard their stain, nor wholly away with<br />
Mortality's plaguespots. It must-be that, O, many wild graffs<br />
Deeply at 'heart engrain'd have rooted strangely upon them:<br />
Wherefore must suffering purge them, yea, Justice atone them<br />
With penalties heavy as their guilt: some purify exposed   <span class="linenum">740</span><br />
Hung to the viewless winds, or others long watery searchings<br />
Low i' the deep wash clean, some bathe in fie<span class="midletter">^</span>ry renewal:<br />
Each cometh unto his own retribution,&mdash;if after in ample<br />
Elysium we attain, but a few, to the fair Happy Woodland,<br />
Yet slow time still worketh on us to remove the defilement,<br />
Till it hath eaten away the acquir'd dross, leaving again free<br />
That first fie<span class="midletter">^</span>ry vigour, the celestia<span class="midletter">^</span>l virtue of our life.<br />
All whom here thou see<span class="midletter">^</span>st, hav' accomplished purification:<br />
Unto the stream of Lethe a god their company calleth,<br />
That forgetful of old failure, pain &amp; disappointment,   <span class="linenum">750</span><br />
They may again into' earthly bodies with glad courage enter.'<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; </span>
<br />
TwÃ­n be the gates o' the house of sleep: as fable opineth   <span class="linenum">893</span><br />
One is of horn, and thence for a true dream outlet is easy:<br />
Fair the other, shining perfected of ivory carven;<br />
But false are the visions that thereby find passage upward.<br />
Soon then as Anchises had spok'n, he-led the Sibyl forth<br />
And his son, and both dismisst from th' ivory portal.<br />
